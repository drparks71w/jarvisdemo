SAMPLE CALCULATIONS
Ex. 600-1 Clear Zone Measurement Using
Slope Averaging (Traversable Ditch)
Problem 1:  Compute the safe distance from the edge of traveled way to locate a tower for lighting. The project has a design speed of 55 mph, a design year traffic volume of 3,400 ADT, and the following cross section in the area where the tower is to be located:
Solution 1:  Step 1 – Check the foreslope from the edge of traveled way to the backslope to determine if all intermediate foreslopes are either recoverable or non-recoverable. (See Figure 600-2).
Since the foreslope has intermediate slopes that are recoverable (12:1 &amp;
4:1) and non-recoverable (3.5:1), the clear zone may extend into the backslope if necessary.
Step 2 – Determine the weighted average of the foreslope. For sections
flatter than or equal to 10:1, use a 10:1 slope. (The 12:1 shoulder is typically ignored; however, for this example it is included for illustrative purposes.) Decimal results of 0.5 or greater should be rounded up to the next whole numbered slope while decimal results less than 0.5 should be rounded down to the next whole numbered slope.
First, multiply the width of each slope by the rate of the slope to obtain the
weighted average rise for the foreslope. Include half of the ditch bottom in the foreslope.
8’ (1/10) + 6’ (1/4) + (0*) + 4’/2 (1/10) = 2.5’
*Since the 3.5:1 foreslope is non-recoverable, it is not included.
January 2024 Location and Design Volume 1
SAMPLE CALCULATIONS
Ex. 600-1 Clear Zone Measurement Using
Slope Averaging (Traversable Ditch)
(continued)    Next, add the width of each foreslope used above.      8’ + 6’ + 4’/2 = 16’
Then, divide the total recoverable width by the weighted average rise to obtain the weighted average of the foreslopes.   16’/2.5’ = 6.4 (Rounded to 6:1 slope)  Now, use Figure 600-1 (for 6:1 foreslopes, 55 mph Design Speed and 1,501 &lt; ADT &lt; 6,000) to determine that the required clear zone distance is 21 feet.  Since the required clear zone is 21 feet and only 16 feet of recoverable clear zone exists, additional width must be considered from the backslope.  Step 3 -Determine if the ditch section is traversable.  Using Figure 307-11, a ditch with a 3.5:1 foreslope and 6:1 backslope is traversable.   If a non-traversable ditch section had been provided then the designer would have to consider other site conditions to determine whether or not the ditch should be used within the clear zone or if guardrail should be installed. (Ex. 3:1 foreslope)  Step 4 – Determine the clear zone using the back slope.  Determine how much of the backslope should be included in the clear zone.   “d” = 21’ – 8’ – 6’ – 4’ = 3’  Therefore, the clear zone must extend 3 feet into the backslope.  The “Recovery Area” includes the clear zone width plus any intermediate widths where the slopes are traversable, but not recoverable.

Ex. 600-2 Clear Zone Measurement For a
Non-Traversable Ditch
Problem 2:  a) Determine the required clear zone distance for the following location on a project with a tangent alignment, a design speed of 55 mph, and a design year traffic volume of 1,700 ADT.
b) Assuming this cross section occurs on the outside of a 2-Degree curve,
how would this change the above results?   c) Determine the clear zone distance for a Degree of Curve of 3 degrees.
Solution 2: a) – The required clear zone distance (for foreslopes steeper than 6:1 up to
4:1, 55 mph design speed, and 1,501 ≤ ADT ≤ 6,000) is 27 feet. 19 feet of clear distance is available up to the center of the ditch. A trapezoidal ditch with a 4:1 foreslope, 2:1 backslope, and a width equal to or greater than 4 feet is a non-traversable design (see Figure 307-11) and generally should not be located within the clear zone. However, if the probability of encroachment is low, no additional improvement may be needed.
b) – Since this location is on the outside of a curve where the probability of
encroachment is high, the designer should consider reshaping the ditch or installing guardrail.
c) – The required clear zone distance determined above for a tangent
alignment needs to be increased by a factor of 1.2 for locations on the outside of curves with a curvature of 3 degrees and a design speed of 55 mph. (See Figure 600-1). The adjusted clear zone distance is 27(1.23) = 33.2’. Since the adjusted value is greater than 30’, use 30’.
Since 19 feet or only 63% of the required clear zone distance exists on the
outside of the curve, the designer should consider reshaping the ditch or installing guardrail.

Problem 3:  Determine the required clear zone distance for the following location on a project with a design speed of 45 mph and a design year traffic volume of 1,300 ADT.
Solution 3: The required clear zone distance (for backslopes steeper than 6:1 up to 4:1,
45 mph design speed and 750 ≤ ADT ≤ 1,500) is 13 feet. (See Figure 600-1). The required clear zone is 13 feet but only 12 feet exist. If this section of roadway has a history of accidents with the cut face then guardrail should be installed.

<p>Need for Barrier at a Fixed Object
Problem 4:  Determine the required clear zone grading limits and additional pipe length
required to extend a 48” culvert within existing right-of-way so that barrier protection can be eliminated. The project conditions are: a rural collector, tangent alignment, 100’ of R/W, design speed of 55 mph, and 3200 ADT.
Solution 4:  Step 1 – Determine lateral clear zone grading limits and minimum culvert
extension length. Refer to Figure 600-1, the clear zone is 21’ when a 6:1 or flatter foreslope is provided, and 27’ with a foreslope steeper than 6:1 to a maximum of 4:1. For this project a 6:1 foreslope is being used. The distance from the edge of traveled way to the back of headwall will need to meet or exceed the clear zone distance. Therefore, the 48” conduit will be extended so that the back of headwall is at least 21’ from the edge of traveled way, and clear zone grading will be provided within that lateral zone.
Note: Although 6:1 is selected for this example, the determination of the foreslope grade will depend on available cover, right-of-way width, and other site &amp; project specific conditions.
Step 2 – Determine the longitudinal limits of the clear zone grading. Refer to Section 307.2.2: clear zone grading is required for the runout length for the warranting feature (the 48” culvert). Refer to Figure 602-1, the Runout Length is 185’ for a 55 mph roadway with 3200 ADT. Note that the clear zone length is measured from the center line for the Opposing Traffic side.

(continued)
The foreslope grading shall be a minimum 6:1 for 185’ on either side of the culvert and for 21’ laterally measured from edge of traveled way. If there are roadside ditches being perpetuated through the hatched area, then they will need to follow Figure 307-10 or 307-11 for the backslope tie-in.  Step 3 – It needs to be confirmed that the extension of the culvert at the applicable grade will intercept the 6:1 foreslope and remain within the right-of-way to ensure the design is in accordance with the project’s constraints.

<p>Need for Barrier at a Fixed Object
(continued)
It is apparent from the cross section that the culvert extension cannot be completed with a 6:1 foreslope as it would have to be extended outside of the existing right-of-way, which is not an option for this project. Therefore, there are two options to consider before purchasing additional right-of-way:</p>
<ol>
<li>Return to Step 1 and change the foreslope to a value steeper than 6:1 to 4:1 maximum, which would cause the clear zone to increase to 27’ (and would affect the graded shoulder width per Figure 301-3).</li>
<li>Utilize the bottom option on Figure 307-3 which allows the foreslope grade to have a break at the clear zone boundary to steeper than 4:1 to 3:1 maximum.
Option 2 has been selected for this example:

<p>Need for Barrier at a Fixed Object
(continued)
Breaking the foreslope at the clear zone boundary to a 4:1 results in the foreslope grade intercepting the top of headwall within the right-of-way. Therefore, a pipe extension of 16’ will meet the project constraints and eliminate the need for barrier when the proper grading is provided. The final step is to update the plan view:

Problem 1: Design barrier if needed to shield the fixed object located on the two-lane
rural collector shown below. The project has a design speed of 60 mph, a design year traffic volume of 2,200 ADT, and a 6:1 foreslope. Assume that the object cannot be removed, relocated, or made traversable.
Solution 1:  Step 1 – Determine whether the fixed object is in the clear zone for adjacent
traffic. Refer to Figure 600-1 (for 6:1 or flatter foreslope, 60 mph design speed, and 1,501 ≤ ADT ≤ 6,000) to determine that the required clear zone distance is 28 feet.
The available clear area for adjacent traffic is 11’ + 4’ = 15’   Since the object cannot be removed, relocated, or made traversable and it is
inside the required clear zone, a barrier should be installed to shield it.

The available barrier clearance at this location is (11’ – 8’) + 4’ = 7 ft; therefore, use MGS Guardrail which has a minimum barrier clearance of 5 ft. (See Figure 603-2).
Step 3 – Calculate the length of need for adjacent traffic. Assume the area along the front of the fixed object cannot be graded to provide 10:1 foreslopes; therefore, the guardrail cannot be installed with a flare.

From Figure 602-1, LR = 210 ft. (for design speed = 60 mph and 1,000 ≤ ADT ≤ 5,000). Since the lateral offset to the back of the object (LH) is less than the required clear zone distance (LC), use LH in the LON formula.</p>

<h5 id="146-60-ft">.  = 146.60 ft.</h5>
<p>Step 4 – Determine whether the fixed object is in the clear zone for opposing traffic. The required clear zone is still 28 feet. The available clear area is  12’ (lane width) + 15’ = 27 ft. Since the object is in the clear zone, calculate the offset to the back of the object, LH.  LH = 12’ + 15’ + 11.5’ = 38.5 ft.
Since LH &gt; LC, protection only needs to be provided up to the clear zone.</p>

(continued)    The total length of guardrail required is:    X(adjacent) + width of object + X(opposing) = 146.60’ + 5’ + 60.00’ = 211.60 ft.    The length provided should be a multiple of even 12’-6” panel lengths.    X = 211.60’/12.5’ = 16.93 → Use 17 panels of 17(12.5’) = 212.5 ft.

<h5 id="100-91-ft">.   = 100.91 ft.</h5>
<p>The total length of guardrail needed would have been:  146.60’ + 5’ + 100.91’ = 252.51 ft. (or 21 panels)  Four additional panels (50 feet) of guardrail would be installed. In some cases, the designer may choose to shield the entire object even though a portion of it is outside the clear zone; however, in some cases it may be uneconomical to do so.  Step 5 – Select Anchor Assemblies. Since the slopes do not allow the guardrail
to be flared, MGS Type E anchor assemblies should be installed.  With the trailing end of the barrier run within the clear zone of opposing traffic, a MGS Type E anchor assembly should be installed on the trailing end of the guardrail run as well.

Problem 3:  Design barrier if needed to shield the 3&#39; diameter footing located on the 4- lane, divided, NHS, urban, interstate reconstruction project shown below. The project has a design speed of 70 mph, a design year traffic volume of 12,000 ADT and a 10:1 foreslope. If barrier is needed, calculate how much should be provided if it is installed a) at the normal (minimum) barrier offset on a tangent, b) at the normal (minimum) barrier offset on a flare, c) as close to the footing as permissible on a tangent and d) as close to the footing as permissible on a flare.
Solution 3:  Step 1 - Determine whether the footing is in the clear zone for adjacent traffic. Refer to Figure 600-1 (for foreslopes 6:1 or flatter, 70 mph design speed, and ADT &gt; 6,000) to determine that the required clear zone distance is 32 feet measured from the edge of traveled way. However, since this is not a high accident area a maximum clear distance of 30&#39; should be used.
The available clear area for adjacent traffic is 15&#39; + 12&#39; = 27&#39;.
Assuming the footing cannot be relocated outside the clear zone, barrier should be provided.
Step 2 - Select the type of barrier to be installed. Using Figures 301-4 &amp; 301-3, the normal (minimum) barrier offset for an urban interstate route is 12&#39; from the right edge of traveled way. The available barrier clearance at this location is 3&#39; + 12&#39; = 15&#39;; therefore, use MGS Guardrail, which has a minimum barrier clearance of 5’. (See Figure 603-2).

(continued)
Step 3 – Calculate the length of need for adjacent traffic. (A calculation for opposing traffic is unnecessary because the concrete median barrier prevents encroachments by opposing vehicles).
From Figure 602-1, LR = 360 ft. (For Design Speed = 70 mph and ADT over 10,000).
a) For tangent guardrail at the normal (minimum) barrier offset, LH = LC = 30’, L2 = 12’, and b/a = 0.</p>
<h5 id="x-3">X =  =</h5>
<h5 id="216-use-18-panels">= 216’ → Use 18 panels</h5>
<p>b) For flared guardrail at the normal (minimum) barrier offset, b/a = 1/7. (See Figure 602-1). Let L1 = 12’-6” (one panel length). In this case, this is an arbitrary selection. Site conditions typically control the amount of tangent barrier that should be provided past the warranting feature before a flare is introduced. For instance, where a flared section of MGS Guardrail is attached to a tangent section of MGS Guardrail with Half Post Spacing, it is advisable to extend the tangent MGS Guardrail with Half Post Spacing past the warranting feature such that L1 is at least equal to 25 feet (two panels) to ensure adequate protection at the edge of the warranting feature.</p>
<h5 id="x-4">X =</h5>

(continued)
c) Guardrail can be installed on slope that are 10:1 or flatter. Since MGS Guardrail has a minimum barrier clearance of 5’ the guardrail can be placed at this distance in front of the footing.
L2 = 15’ + 12’ – 5’ = 22’. For tangent guardrail, b/a = 0. LH is still equal to 30’.
X =</p>

<p>d) For flared guardrail offset at 22’:

<h5 id="43-26-use-4-panels">= 43.26’ → Use 4 panels.</h5>
<p>All of these solutions are correct; however, d) is the best solution because it provides the most recovery area with the least amount of barrier.

<h5 id="ex-602-4-barrier-on-the-outside-of-a-curve">Ex. 602-4 Barrier on the Outside of a Curve</h5>
<p>Problem 4: Calculate the barrier length of need to shield the 200-yr old 5-ft. diameter tree
located on the outside of a 3-degree curve as shown below. The HSP project is on a rural arterial and has a design speed of 55 mph, a design year traffic volume of 3,800 ADT and 5:1 foreslopes. Assume that the HSP project is needed to address run-off-the-road impacts with the tree and also assume that the tree cannot be removed.
Solution 4:  Step 1 – Determine whether the tree is in the clear zone for adjacent traffic.
From Figure 600-1 (for foreslopes steeper than 6:1 up to 4:1, 55 mph design speed, and 1,501 ≤ ADT ≤ 6,000) the required clear zone distance is 27 feet measured from the edge of traveled way. Since the tree is on the outside of a 3-degree curve, the clear zone should be widened by using the curve correction factor for 55 mph design speed (1.2) from the chart at the bottom of Figure 600-1.
Required Clear Zone = 1.23(27’) = 33.21 ft.   Do not reduce this value to 30 ft. since this is a high accident location.   The offset to the face of the tree is 12’ + 10’ = 22 ft. This is less than LC =
33.21 ft.; therefore, install barrier.

<h5 id="ex-602-4-barrier-on-the-outside-of-a-curve-2">Ex. 602-4 Barrier on the Outside of a Curve</h5>
<p>(continued)
Step 2 – Select the type of barrier to be installed. Using Figure 301-3, the normal (minimum) barrier offset for a rural arterial (Design year ADT greater than 2,000) is 10 feet from the right edge of traveled way. The available barrier clearance at this location is 12 feet; therefore, use MGS Guardrail, which has a minimum barrier clearance of 5 feet (See Figure 603-2).  Step 3 – Calculate the length of need for adjacent traffic. The radius for the 3-degree curve is Rcenterline = 5729.58/DC = 5729.58/3.0 = 1909.86’  The radius at the edge of traveled way is 1909.86’ + 12’ = 1921.86’.  The lateral offset to the back of the tree is LH = 22’ + 5’ = 27’.  θ1 = cos-1 (Radj / (Radj + LH)) = cos-1 (1921.86 / (1921.86 + 27)) = 9.5484⁰   9.5484⁰(π/180) = 0.1666 radians  θ2 = cos-1 (Radj / (Radj + L2)) = cos-1 (1921.86 / (1921.86 + 10)) = 5.8323⁰
5.8323⁰(π/180) = 0.1018 radians    X = (Radj + L2)(θ1 + θ2) = (1921.86 + 10)(0.1666 + 0.1018) = 125.18’

<h5 id="ex-602-4-barrier-on-the-outside-of-a-curve-3">Ex. 602-4 Barrier on the Outside of a Curve</h5>
<p>(continued)
Step 4 – Determine whether the tree is within the clear zone for opposing traffic. The offset to the face of the tree is 12’ + 12’ + 10’ = 34’. Since this is outside the clear zone, guardrail is not needed last the left side of the tree to shield it from opposing traffic.  The total length of guardrail needed is 125.18’ + 5’ = 130.18’ →  Use 11 panels (137.5’)  Refer to Table 603-1 in Section 603.3.3 to determine the recommended anchor assembly for an HSP project with foreslopes steeper than 6:1 up to 4:1. On the approach end install a Type E Anchor Assembly. Since 37’-6” of the 50’ long Type E can be deducted from the guardrail length of need, decrease the amount of rail specified above at the approach end by this amount. (Use 100’). On the trailing end install a Type T Anchor Assembly because it is outside the clear zone for opposing traffic.  Notes – If a point of curvature exists in the vicinity of the runout path, the curve may need to be extended past the PC or OT (into the tangent portion of the roadway) to construct the tangent control line. If this is the case, then the standard runout lengths for tangent roadways should be used to calculate length of need.</p>
