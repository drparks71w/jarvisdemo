Preface
Purpose
Highway plans must ultimately satisfy many needs. In addition to the obvious needs of contractors who build the project, plans must serve the needs of designers, project engineers and inspectors, reviewers, and other interested parties. These plans become a part of the construction agreement and serve as an historic record.  Since highway plans incorporate the expertise of many specialty governmental units, organizations and personnel, various reviews are necessary throughout the plan preparation process.
Application
The guidelines contained in this manual are considered a primary source of reference by personnel involved in the preparation of highway plans for the State of Ohio.  Although this manual is an attempt to standardize the form and the process for highway plan preparation in Ohio, it is recognized that many projects will involve unusual circumstances which will require deviation from these guidelines.
Preparation
This manual has been developed by the Office of CADD and Mapping Services. Errors or omissions should be reported to the Administrator, Office of CADD and Mapping Services. A list of contacts can be found on the CADD and Mapping Services | Ohio Department of Transportation website.
Format and Revisions
A separate set of Sample Construction Plans is available and considered to be an integral part of the Plan Preparation Manual.  Manuals and revisions may be downloaded from the Publications Gateway web page. Users are encouraged to sign up on this page for electronic (email) notification of revisions.  ODOT’s Website can be accessed at <a href="https://www.transportation.ohio.gov/">https://www.transportation.ohio.gov/</a>.
Unit of Measure
Plans are to be prepared using the English system of units.    Standard Construction Drawings (SCDs) are listed using only the root number of the drawing (e.g., BP-3.1 rather than BP-3.1M).  Highway plans must always use the SCD showing the most up-to-date details available.  The most current SCD may be in English and/or dual (English and metric) units.

<p>1201 General Plan Sheet Information
1201.1 Introduction
The purpose of a set of construction plans is to delineate the proposed work with sufficient design details, supplemented with notes, calculations, and summaries of quantities, in such a manner that it can be clearly and uniformly interpreted by engineers and contractors. Sufficient data must be provided to enable the contractor to make an intelligent bid and perform the work as intended. Clarity, completeness, and conciseness are essential to avoid misinterpretation. Unnecessary details should be avoided.
1201.2 Unit of Measure
Plans shall be prepared using the English system of units.
1201.3 Plan Sheet Format
Plans should be submitted in a non-rasterized PDF format, except for the Right of Way Centerline Plat Sheet.    Where an external agency does not allow submission of a PDF, the District Project Manager will determine whether the hard copy document will be created by the District or by the consultant. The requirement to produce hard copy documents shall be included in the Scope of Services document.  Hard copies shall match the PDF and shall be printed on paper.
1201.4 Plan Sheet Dimensions
All plan sheets, including plans prepared by sub-consultants (i.e., geotechnical profile sheets), shall be the same size and format. PDF files shall be formatted to be 22 inches by 34 inches as shown in Figure 1201-1, except for the following:  Right of Way Centerline Plat Sheet that has been hand signed and stamped can be scanned in at original size.
1201.5 Title Block Information
1201.5.1 General
Figure 1201-1 shows the location of the border and title block for standard size plan sheets. An example title block is shown in Figure 1201-2. The Bridge Design Manual and Real Estate Manual show standard structures and right-of-way title sheet blocks, respectively. All plan sheets shall display, as a minimum, the plan sheet number, the project designation and the sheet title. Additional items that may be required include quantity validation initials, plan scales and a north arrow.
1201.5.2 Sheet Numbers
Sheet numbers are shown in the lower right corner of the sheet and shall be prefixed with “P.” (e.g., P.1, P.2,…P.26). With the exception of the Right of Way Plan Sheets, a sheet number and total (total number of sheets in the plan based on the last actual sheet number) shall be included. Sheets that require subset sheet numbers (e.g., structure plans and right-of-way plans) may be grouped within the plan.
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
18
Occasionally, sheets may need to be inserted into a set of plans that has already been numbered. These sheets should be labeled with the number of the preceding sheet, followed by consecutive letters (e.g., P.26A, P.26B…P.26Z) and then by consecutive double letters (e.g., P.26AA, P.26BB…P.26ZZ). This will permit the insertion of up to 52 additional sheets. The last sheet shall not be labeled with a number/letter combination. If a significant number of sheets need to be inserted or added to a set of plans, consideration should be given to renumbering the entire set.
1201.5.3 Project Designation
The project designation is normally the county code, route number, and section number as shown in the plan title on the Title Sheet (See Section 1302). When multiple section numbers are involved and space in the title block does not permit a complete listing, the county, all route numbers, and the first section number followed by the words “and various” will be shown.
1201.5.4 Sheet Title
The sheet title shall include: the general plan sheet description (e.g., Schematic Plan, General Summary, Plan and Profile, Cross-Sections, etc.), the applicable roadway, if not obvious (e.g., U.S. 35, S.R. 315, Ramp A, Main Street, Connecting Road, etc.) and the applicable station limits.
1201.5.5 Quantity Validation
Where sheets include quantities, space should be provided for the date and initials of the individuals who calculated and checked the quantities.
1201.5.6 Plan Scales
A bar scale should be shown whenever a plan view is required. Bar scales are not normally required in the vertical dimension on profiles or for cross-sections since these should be adequately labeled. If the plan sheet requires more than one scale, bar scales will be shown on the plan and the words “See Details” shown in the title block.
1201.5.7 North Arrow
A north arrow should be shown as accurately as possible (usually +/- 5°) whenever a plan view is required. If the plan sheet contains more than one plan view, no north arrow should be shown in the title block.
1201.5.8 Additional Requirements
The Bridge Design Manual, Section 100 and the Real Estate Manual, Section 3100 contain additional requirements for bridge and right-of-way plan sheets, respectively.
1201.5.9 PID Number
Each project is assigned a unique Project Identification (PID) Number when it is entered into Ellis. This number shall be shown in the proper space on the title block. On occasion, this number may change during project development. The plan, file names and directory structure shall always reflect the latest number, with former numbers noted on the Title Sheet. See Section 1302 for additional information regarding the title sheet.
1202 Drafting
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
19
1202.1 Plan Scales
The designer should prepare plans keeping in mind that a 22-inch by 34-inch full-size plan sheet may be reproduced to a 11 inch by 17-inch print.   It is recommended that plan sheet scales normally be limited to the following:  For English unit plan sheets: 1:1, 1:5, 1:10, 1:20, 1:50, 1:100, 1:200, 1:500 or 1:1000. These scales are in inches per foot. For example, 1:20 indicates 1 inch on the plan sheet equals 20 feet in the field.  Scales that are multiples of ten of the above scales may be used (i.e., 1:2000 is a multiple of 1:200). If it is believed that a better product will result, other scales may be used. The intent should always be to clearly and adequately show the work to be performed, keeping in mind that the plans used during construction could be reduced to one-half the original scale (i.e., 1:20 full size prints become 1:40 quarter size prints).
1202.2 Lettering
Lettering should be oriented in such a manner that it can be read from either the bottom or right side of the plan sheet. Fonts &amp; text sizes shall be per Section 1204, Computer-Aided Drafting and Design.
1202.3 Cross-Section Grids
Acceptable grid systems for cross-sections and profiles are shown in Figure 1202-1. Letters and lines should be bolder when they are superimposed over cross-section grids.
1202.4 Drafting Conventions
The following sections present the preferred standard drafting guidelines for roadway construction plans.  Standard drafting symbols are available from the Office of CADD and Mapping Services, CADD Services website.
1202.4.1 Text Orientation
Text on inclined lines should be orientated as shown.
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
20
1202.4.2 Placement of Leaders from Notes
A leader line should originate from the first line on the left, the last line on the right, or from a vertical bar on either side, as shown. The leader should generally be an inclined straight line, if possible, except for the short horizontal shoulder extending from mid-height of the lettering at the beginning or end of a note.  Where space prohibits the use of straight leader lines, curved leaders may be used. Curves should be smooth and simple, beginning with a short, horizontal, shoulder extending from mid-height of the lettering.
12.2.4.3 Placement of Leaders to, or from, a Circular Object
A leader to, or from, a circular object should extend radially, so that if extended it would pass through the center of the circle.
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
21
1204.4.4 Terminators
Leaders should terminate with an arrowhead when pointing to an object or to an edge and should terminate as shown when pointing to a surface or layer.
1202.4.5 Placement of Balloons
Balloons on typical sections should be aligned as much as possible, rather than placed randomly around the section. The leader lines extending from the bubbles to pavement layers should be vertical, where possible. Other items, such as guardrail and underdrains may be labeled with straight, inclined, leaders. All leaders should end with a terminator.
1202.4.6 Sheet Notes, Charts, and Summary Sheets
Groups of sheet notes shall be left justified.
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
22
Text in charts should be placed slightly above the lines (never directly on the line) to improve readability. It is recommended to leave an empty line at the beginning and end of the chart and between every fifth item to accommodate future additions.
Numbers with decimals in a chart should be aligned in columns along the decimal point. Integer values should be either right justified or centered in columns.
1202.4.7 Overdrafting
It is preferable to place dimensions outside areas which contain cross-hatching and other line work. Where this is not possible, the cross-hatching, or line work, should be broken around the text.  Hatch lines should never cross through text, however, certain critical line work elements, such as centerlines may pass through text.
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
23
1202.4.8 Horizontal Curve Data
The curve data should be shown on the inside of the specified curve and between the PC and PT, where possible. As shown, it is permissible to jog the lines for the PC and PT provided the initial portions of the lines extending from the curve are along the correct radius.
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
24
When space prohibits or when an alignment has a large number of horizontal curves, label each curve and tabulate the curve data. If it is necessary to tabulate curve data for a few curves along an alignment, then all curves should be tabulated to provide consistency.
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
25
1202.4.9 Dashed Lines
When needed for clarity, dashed lines should connect at all points of intersection and points of tangency. (You may need to subdivide certain CADD cells into individual elements in order to connect the lines properly).
When needed for clarity, a gap should be shown at all locations where a visible edge becomes hidden by another surface as shown below.
1202.4.10 Direction of Cross-Hatch Lines
In general, draw cross-hatched lines at 45° with horizontal.  If cross-hatch lines drawn at 45° with horizontal would be parallel or perpendicular (or nearly so) to a prominent visible outline, the angle should be modified.

27
12.2.4.11 Placement of Dimension Text
Generally, text should be placed above a solid dimension line and oriented parallel to the line, as shown below.  Horizontal text shall be read parallel to the bottom edge of the sheet. Vertical text shall be read parallel to the right edge of the sheet.  Text in dimension strings should be placed at the same level.   See examples below:
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
28
1202.4.12 Angular Dimensions
Angular dimensions should be placed with an arc drawn from the vertex of the angle.
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
29
1202.4.13 Dimensions in Crowded Conditions
In crowded conditions, gaps in extension lines near arrowheads may be left as shown below, in order to clarify the dimensions.
1202.4.14 Dimensioning with a Dot
If the dimension cannot be placed on the dimension line, then a dot with a curved leader may be used as shown.
1202.4.15 Dimensioning at Angles
Dimension lines must always be drawn parallel to the edge being dimensioned. Extension lines are usually drawn at right angles to the edge being dimensioned. However, an exception may be made in the interest of clarity, as shown.
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
30
1202.4.16 Dimensioning an Object
Place shorter dimensions nearest to the object outline. As shown below, crossing the extension lines is acceptable. Dimension lines should not cross extension lines as a result of placing the shorter dimensions on the outside.
Extension lines should not be shortened.  Also, a dimension line should never coincide with or form a continuation of any line of the drawing.  If possible, dimensions should always be placed off the object.
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
31
1202.4.17 Crossing Dimension Lines
Extension lines should not be broken. In addition, lines should not be centered at object edges.
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
32
1202.4.18 Grouped Dimensions
Grouped dimensions should be in line, evenly spaced and off the object being dimensioned.
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
33
1202.4.19 Use of “Typical”
For symmetrical objects and repetitive dimensions, use the word “typical” to simplify dimensioning, as shown:
1203 Standard Drawings
1203.1 Standard Construction Drawings
Standard Construction Drawings are an integral part of the contract plans. They are used to show repetitive details such as: manholes, curbs, guardrail, and pavement joints. When referenced in the plans, these drawings, and their associated revision dates, must be listed on the Title Sheet.
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
34
1203.2 Plan Insert Sheets
Plan Insert Sheets are similar to Standard Construction Drawings but differ in the manner in which they are included in the plans. They often cover the design of standard items that are in the development stage. Plan Insert Sheets are included with the original set of construction plans. When included in a set of construction plans, project specific information must be added to these sheets.  Refer to the Publications Gateway website: (<a href="https://www.transportation.ohio.gov/working/publications">https://www.transportation.ohio.gov/working/publications</a>) for the most recent version of the Plan Insert Sheets.
1204 Computer-Aided Drafting and Design (CADD)
1204.1 General
1204.1.1 Introduction
Computer-Aided Drafting and Design (CADD) is the preferred method of preparing plans for the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT). These requirements ensure that CADD files can be used by the entire project team (surveyors, planners, environmentalists, designers, reviewers, contractors, etc.) throughout all phases of project development.   The standards referenced have been developed and tested using the Bentley Systems CONNECT Edition generation of products.   This section supersedes all CADD standards previously published in the Bridge Design Manual and the Right-of-Way Manual.  This section is not a textbook and does not exempt the professional from performing responsible engineering and/or surveying. It is intended to provide uniform procedures and standards for ODOT staff and organizations that perform CADD related services for ODOT. The professional shall have final responsibility for the accuracy of all input and output of computer-based applications.
1204.1.2 Software
ODOT has adopted and operates internally using Bentley Systems CONNECT Edition generation of products (including but not limited to MicroStation (MS), OpenRoads Designer (ORD), and OpenBridge Modeler (OBM)) as its standard drafting and design software packages, respectively.   ODOT will accept electronic deliverables generated from non-Bentley Systems CONNECT Edition generation of products; however, the CADD design software to be used on a project shall be mutually agreed upon by the District and primary design consultant and shall be explicitly stated in the project’s scope of services. ODOT will provide no support, standards, documentation, or guidance of any kind with respect to design and delivery of projects developed using other CADD platforms.   Once the decision has been made to use a software package other than Bentley Systems CONNECT Edition generation of products there shall be no deviation from the agreed upon design package, and the same shall be used for all aspects of the project and by all entities until the project’s completion. It is the primary design consultant’s responsibility to ensure that all sub-consultants use the agreed upon design package.   The final deliverables of a non-Bentley Systems CONNECT Edition generation of products designed project, in printed or electronic format, shall adhere to the standards provided herein. The electronic deliverables shall be delivered in the native format.

1204.2 CADD Standards
1204.2.1 Installation and Configuration
1204.2.1.1 General  This section outlines the setup for a typical installation of Bentley Systems CONNECT Edition generation of products at ODOT. The configuration files discussed in this section are available from the ODOT CADD Standards Downloads website.  The OHDOT Standards can be downloaded from the ODOT CADD Services webpage.
1204.2.1.2 Installation  For a typical ODOT installation, Bentley Systems CONNECT Edition generation of products software is installed in the default location.
1204.2.1.3 CADD Standards Directory  The configuration and associated files for Bentley Systems CONNECT Edition generation of products that are used for plan development at ODOT are located within ProjectWise at the following location:   Ohio DOT Projects\Documents\03 Standards\CADD Standards\CONNECT_Config\Workspaces\OHDOTCEv02\  Configuration information for users external to ODOT can be found on the ODOT CADD Services webpage.
1204.2.1.4 Configuration Variables and Files  Configuration variables are defined in tow locations within the OHDOT CADD Standards environment:</p>
<ul>
<li>OHDOT_WorkSpace.cfg defines configuration variables and standards that apply to all projects developed
using the OHDOT Workspace.</li>
<li>Project specific variables are defined in a WorkSet Configuration file.
The OHDOT Workspace does not define a custom location for user configuration files. User configuration files are in the default directory as defined by Bentley software.
1204.2.2 Assignments
1204.2.2.1 General  ODOT has developed a standard set of levels to be used with all design files submitted to or exchanged with the Department. The levels are defined in a MicroStation DGN Library, OHDOT_Feature_Definitions.dgnlib.  Users shall not create their own levels for use in any design files submitted or exchanged with ODOT.
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
36
See the OHDOT CADD Levels for a complete list of the ODOT levels.
1204.2.2.2 Level Naming Convention  ODOT level names use the following naming convention:  Classification_Disposition_Logical Name  This Classification consists of two (2) uppercase characters used to group the levels into categories. The Classification names are listed in the table below:
Classification  Description  Classification  Description  AP  Airports  PC Point Clouds BD  Buildings  PF Profile  BM Bridge Modeling PM Pavement Markings BR  Bridge  PV  Pavement  CL  Centerline  RC  Recreational  CM  Corridor Modeling  RD  Roadway  DR  Drainage  RS  Raster Files  DT  Digital Terrain Models  RW  Right-of-Way  DV  Divisions  SC  Scratch  EV  Environmental  SG  Signals  FL  Flight Mapping  SH  Sheets  GE  Geometry  SN  Signing  GM County Map SV Survey GT  Geotechnical  TR  Truck Turning Paths  HY  Hydraulics  TX  Text  LT  Lighting  UT  Utilities  MD  Modeling  VG  Vegetation  MT  Maintenance of Traffic  VL  Volume  MU Markup XS Cross Section
The Disposition is used to identify the level for placement of either X (existing) or P (proposed) information.   The Logical Name is used to as a description of the element contents. Where appropriate, common industry abbreviations are used.  All ODOT levels names use alphanumeric characters only. No spaces or special characters are used other than the underscore “_” character.
1204.2.2.3 ByLevel Considerations  In general, to facilitate use of MicroStation’s ByLevel attributes, the ODOT levels have been established such that each curvilinear feature will have its own level. To keep the overall number of levels manageable, there are cases where similar features will be placed on the same level making it impossible to use ByLevel attributes for those features. Some exceptions are noted below:
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
37</li>
<li>Standard ODOT cells are placed on the level in which they were created. Each cell is not placed on its own level, rather, like cells are grouped on one level. For example, existing electric utility cells are all placed on the level UT_X_Electric_Cells.</li>
<li>Maintenance of Traffic Drums – Multiple line styles have been created to represent various typical drum spacings. These lines are placed on level MT_P_Drums.
<em>1204.2.2.4 Filters</em>
ODOT’s level library, found in OHDOT_Feature_Definitions.dgnlib, has been configured with a set of default level filters that can be used to control the display of levels based on their attributes. Users shall not edit or delete the default filters.
1204.2.2.5 Priority and Transparency  The levels defined in OHDOT_Feature_Definitions.dgnlib utilize MicroStation’s Element Priority and Transparency functions. The priorities and transparencies are preset and based on what level is being used and should not be changed. See the OHDOT CADD Levels for a complete list of Priority and Transparency values.
1204.2.3 Colors
1204.2.3.1 General  Standard colors are specified to ensure consistency and to enable users to easily identify plan elements in shared files. For uniformity, the ODOT color table must be used and shall not be altered. See OHDOT CADD Colors for a complete list of ODOT’s color table values.   Note: The color values may vary or appear different on screen due to the difference in graphics cards, monitors display capability, etc.
1204.2.4 Line Styles
1204.2.4.1 General  Line styles are used to differentiate curvilinear elements in the design file and on the plotted sheet. ODOT uses Bentley’s default line styles, zero (0) through seven (7), along with ODOT’s developed set of Custom Line Styles. The line styles must be used to provide consistency and uniformity across plans.   The custom line style definitions are stored in a MicroStation DGN Library, OHDOT_Feature_Definitions.dgnlib.  Users shall not create their own custom line styles for use on ODOT plan sheets. Standard line codes and custom line styles for plan graphics are specified in the OHDOT CADD Levels and displayed in OHDOT CADD Line Styles.
1204.2.4.2 Line Style Scales  The location and dimensions of all plan view basemap design file information shall be drawn in the Design model using real world dimensions at a 1:1 scale. Custom Line Styles are to be placed in the basemap at a scale of one (1) so the Drawing Scale feature can be used.   Referenced basemap design files when referenced into another file should have the line style scale se to Annotation Scale for proper scaling inside the new file.
1204.2.4.2.1 Survey Processing using Open Roads
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
38
Survey data processed using OpenRoads Survey is drawn at real world dimensions. Line Styles are according to the current MicroStation Drawing Scale setting and will respond to changes in the Drawing Scale value.
1204.2.4.2.2 Sheet Files  For basemap design files referenced into sheet files, the global line style scale must be set to Master for proper scaling to match the sheet file.
1204.2.4.2.3 Bridge Line Styles  Several line styles have been developed specifically for use on Bridge plans that are not always placed at a specific scale relative to the plotting scale. The line styles listed in the table below shall be scaled as necessary to produce a legible detail. These line styles are assigned to the appropriate level by use of ByLevel attributes.
Line Style Name  Description   bcenterline   Centerline   bconstruction   Construction Joint / Phase Construction Line   bexisting   Existing Objects (all existing lines except existing reinforcement bars)   bhiddenpr   Hidden Line Proposed   brebarpr   Proposed Reinforcement Bars   brebarex   Existing Reinforcement Bars
1204.2.5 Line Weights
1204.2.5.1 General  Line weights are used to differentiate graphical elements in the design file and on the plotted sheet. Default line weights per level are specified in the OHDOT CADD Levels.
1204.2.5.2 Plotting  See Section 1204.4, Plotting for line weight plotting thickness values.
1204.2.6 Cell Libraries
1204.2.6.1 General  For plan consistency, ODOT provides standard cell libraries containing cells representing items that will be repeatedly placed in a design file. Several ODOT standard cell libraries are available as detailed in Section 1204.2.6.2 – Cell Libraries (below).
<em>1204.2.6.2 Cell Libraries</em>
The following cell libraries are available to facilitate the drawing of commonly used symbols and sheet borders as described below:
Cell Library  Description  OHDOT_Aviation.cel Cells used for Aviation plans OHDOT_Bridge.cel  Cells used for bridge plans  OHDOT_Drainage.cel  Cells used for 2D standard drainage structures
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
39
OHDOT_DrainageAndUtilities.cel  Cells used for standard drainage structures   OHDOT_Geotech.cel  Cells used for geotechnical information  OHDOT_Labels.cel  Cells used for ORD plan labels  OHDOT_RW.cel  Cells used for right-of-way plans  OHDOT_Sheets.cel  Cells used for standard plan sheet borders  OHDOT_Symbols.cel  Cells representing standard plan symbols
Additionally, a set of cell libraries including standard signs from the Office of Roadway Engineering’s Sign Designs and Markings Manual, is included in the OHDOT CADD Standards. These sign cells are easily placed using a custom application, also provided in the OHDOT CADD Standards.
1204.2.7 Fonts
1204.2.7.1 General  The TrueType fonts Calibri and Calibri Light will be used for all plans developed using the OHDOT CADD Standards.   To supplement the use of font Calibri, the OHDOT Workspace includes a custom symbol font, OHDOTSymbols.ttf, containing commonly used engineering symbols.
1204.2.7.2 Text Size  Standard text sizes have been defined to ensure uniform legibility of all plan sheets. Standard text size refers to the size of the text on a full sized (22”x34”) sheet, not the text size in the design file.
Text Type  Plotted Text Size   Normal  0.14”  Subtitle  0.17”  Title  0.20”  Main Title  0.25”
Text sizes smaller than the Normal text size are not acceptable.   For all ODOT plans, the preferred method to set the text size is by use of the Model Annotation Scale parameter. See Section 1204.2.7.4 – Text Styles (below) for more information.
1204.2.7.4 Text Styles  ODOT’s standard text styles are defined in a MicroStation DGN Library, OHDOT_Text_Dimension_Styles.dgnlib.   The following Text Styles have been configured for use on ODOT plans:
Text Style  Text Size*  Spacing*  Font  P_Slanted - Normal Fixed Spacing  0.14  1.00  Calibri  P_Slanted - Normal LS=0.50  0.14  0.50  Calibri  P_Slanted - Normal LS=0.50 Masked  0.14  0.50  Calibri  P_Slanted - Normal LS=0.75  0.14  0.75  Calibri  P_Slanted - Normal LS=1.00  0.14  1.00  Calibri

<em>Text size and Line Spacing units are Master Units.
Note: There is additional text styles included in the OHDOT CADD Standards. These text styles, which are not listed above, are configured for specific ORD labeling tasks, and are not normally selected by the user for general plan preparation annotation purposes.
All text placed on Bridge sheets, excluding text contained in standard border cells and existing topographic features, shall use the “Slanted” text styles.
<em>1204.2.7.5 Dimension Styles</em>
ODOT has configured a set of dimension styles to be used on ODOT plans.  These styles are defined in the ODOT Standard DGN Library, OHDOT_Text_Dimension_Styles.dgnlib, which can be obtained from the ODOT CADD Standards website.
The following dimension styles have been defined in OHDOT_Text_Dimension_Styles.dgnlib:
Dimension Style  Font  Text Size</em>  Description  P_Dec-0, Masked, Slanted  Calibri  0.14  Decimal Feet, No decimal places  P_Dec-1, Masked, Slanted Calibri 0.14 Decimal Feet, 1 decimal places P_Dec-2, Masked, Slanted Calibri 0.14 Decimal Feet, 2 decimal places P_Dec-Multiline, Masked, Slanted Calibri 0.14 Decimal Feet, 0.01 accuracy P_Fract, Masked, Slanted Calibri 0.14  Fractions, 1/16” accuracy  P_Fract, Slanted Calibri 0.14  Fractions, 1/16” accuracy  P_Fract-Multiline, Masked, Slanted Calibri 0.14  Fractions, 1/16” accuracy  X_Dec-0, Masked, Straight  Calibri Light 0.14  Decimal Feet, No decimal places  X_Dec-1, Masked, Straight  Calibri Light 0.14  Decimal Feet, 1 decimal places  X_Dec-2, Masked, Straight  Calibri Light 0.14  Decimal Feet, 2 decimal places  X_Dec-Multiline, Masked, Straight  Calibri Light 0.14  Decimal Feet, 0.01 accuracy  X_Fract, Masked, Straight Calibri Light 0.14  Fractions, 1/16” accuracy  X_Fract, Straight Calibri Light 0.14  Fractions, 1/16” accuracy  X_Fract-Multiline, Masked, Straight Calibri Light 0.14  Fractions, 1/16” accuracy

Note: There is additional dimension styles included in the OHDOT CADD Standards. These dimension styles, which are not listed above, are configured for specific ORD labeling tasks, and are not normally selected by the user for general plan preparation annotation purposes.    Line Terminators shall be a filled arrow created with a width to height ratio of 2.5:1. The terminator width shall equal the text height.   Leader Lines or Extension Lines may be broken when crossing dimension lines but should be avoided wherever possible. To keep broken lines to a minimum, it is recommended that the user relocated the dimension callout, reposition the dimension, and/or reposition the callout. Leader, dimension, extension lines, and terminators shall be a weight of zero (0) and shall be placed on the same level as required for text notes and callouts.   Like Text Styles, the text size for Dimension Styles is set by use of the Model Annotation Scale parameter.   Bridge plans shall use the “Fract, Slanted”, “Fract-Multiline, Slanted” or “Masked Fract, Slanted”, “Masked Fract-Multiline, Slanted” dimension styles.  All Bridge dimensions shall be placed associated.   Dimensions shall not have their status dropped.
1204.2.8 Seed Files
1204.2.8.1 General  MicroStation uses a “seed file” to create all design files.  A seed file is a template in which standard parameters are set.  Seed files do not contain elements, but like other design files they do contain settings like working units and view configurations. Using a standard, customized seed file helps maintain uniformity and keeps the user from having to adjust design file settings each time a file is created.
The following seed files are included with the OHDOT CADD Standards download. The Geographic Coordinate System (GCS) for each seed file is defined as shown in the table below:
Dimension  Seed File Name  Geographic Coordinate System  2D OHDOT_Seed2d.dgn  None  2D OHDOT_Seed2d_OH83-2011-NF.dgn  OH83-2011-NF  2D OHDOT_Seed2d_OH83-2011-SF.dgn  OH83-2011-SF  2D OHDOT_Seed2d_OH83-NF.dgn  OH83-NF  2D OHDOT_Seed2d_OH83-SF.dgn  OH83-SF  2D *OHDOT_Seed2d_xxxxxxx_SurvFt.dgn NAVD88 3D OHDOT_Seed3d.dgn  None  3D OHDOT_Seed3d_OH83-2011-NF.dgn  OH83-2011-NF  3D OHDOT_Seed3d_OH83-2011-SF.dgn  OH83-2011-SF  3D OHDOT_Seed3d_OH83-NF.dgn  OH83-NF  3D OHDOT_Seed3d_OH83-SF.dgn  OH83-SF  3D *OHDOT_Seed3d_xxxxxxx_SurvFt.dgn NAVD88 2D OHDOT_DrawingSeed2d.dgn  None  2D OHDOT_SheetSeed2d.dgn  None</li>
<li>xxxxxxx = County name
<em>1204.2.8.2 Models</em>
ODOT’s seed files are defined to include only one MicroStation Model. The seed files are defined with a Design, Sheet, or Drawing model according to the intended usage file.
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025

1204.2.9 Working Units
1204.2.9.1 General  The OHDOT CADD Standards include a standard unit definition file, OHDOT_Units.def, to define the U.S. Survey Foot as the standard Master Unit.   MicroStation design files used in plan preparation shall use the following standard working units as defined in the ODOT seed files and in OHDOT_Units.def:
Unit Names  Label  Master Unit: U.S. Survey Feet  ‘  Sub Unit: U.S. Survey Inches  “
The ODOT seed files have been defined with a standard resolution setting of 12000 per U.S. Survey Foot.  This setting shall not be changed by the user.   ODOT’s seed files are set up with the standard working units described above.  Deviation from these working units is not permitted.
1204.2.10 Global Origin
1204.2.10.1 General  In the ODOT Seed files, the point called the Global Origin is set to the design plane&#39;s exact center and assigned the coordinates 0,0 (2D files) and 0,0,0 (3D files).
The Global Origin is defined in ODOT’s Seed Files and should never be changed for ODOT projects.
1204.2.11 Custom Applications
1204.2.11.1 General  ODOT has written several programs to assist the user with specific CADD related functions. Each application can be accessed from the MicroStation CE or ORD Ribbon by selecting the OHDOT workflow.
1204.2.11.2 DGN Libraries  Several MicroStation DGN Libraries have been configured within the OHDOT workspace, for use with MicroStation CE and ORD, as detailed below.   OHDOT_DesignStandards.dgnlib  This DGN Library defines the Design Standards for Horizontal and Vertical alignments according to various standards defined in the Location and Design Manual, Volume 1 – Roadway Design.   OHDOT_Feature_Definitions.dgnlib  This DGN Library defines OpenRoads features for design and survey, as well as the MicroStation levels and element templates. The DGN Library also defines the default Survey Settings for OpenRoads.     OHDOT_Features_DrainageAndUtilities.dgnlib  This DGN Library defines OpenRoads features for subsurface utility modeling, computation, and analysis.

<em>1204.2.11.3 Template Libraries</em>
ODOT provides a template library, OHDOT_Templates.itl, with several templates and components that can be used as a starting point to design the typical sections for the proposed roadway corridor.
1204.3 File Management
1204.3.1 General
File management refers to how documents are organized and stored. Its primary purpose is to provide a safe repository for information and to minimize the possibility of that information being lost.
1204.3.2 Project Directory Structure
1204.3.2.1 Standard Directory Structure  A standard project directory shall be used to house all project related data for the various workflows involved in the project development process throughout the lifecycle of the project.   Alphanumeric characters, a dash “-“ and an underscore “_”, are the only characters permitted in folder names. No other special characters, or spaces, are permitted in any folder name.   A template folder structure is used for all projects. See OHDOT CADD Project  Folders for the documented template folder structure.   A template folder structure is provided in the OHDOT CADD Standards in the following location:
\OHDOT\Standards\WorkSetTemplates\000000_OHDOT_Template  The project folder structure is also referred to as a “WorkSet”.
1204.3.2.2 OHDOTCreate Work Set.exe  The OHDOT WorkSet Creation Tool is a standalone application that is integrated with ProjectWise.  This application is used to assist in creating new project “Workset” and can be launched from within the standards:
..\OHDOTCEv02\Standards\Applications\OHDOTCreateWorkSet.exe  It can also be launched from the MicroStation, ORD, or OBM ribbon within the OHDOT Workflow &gt; Apps tab.  For more information on using the OHDOT Workset Creation Tool please refer to the tutorial videos.   <a href="https://bentleysystems.service-now.com/community?id=kb_article_view&amp;sysparm_article=KB0024577">https://bentleysystems.service-now.com/community?id=kb_article_view&amp;sysparm_article=KB0024577</a>
1204.3.3 Design Files
1204.3.3.1 Basemap Design Files  Basemap design files are used to draw existing and proposed plan view information for the entire length of the project for both Roadway and Bridge projects.   Plan view information is separated into multiple discipline-specific basemap design files as listed below:
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
44
Plan View Basemap Files
Aerial Mapping  Lighting  Bridge  Maintenance of Traffic  Drainage  Proposed Roadway  Environmental  Right-of-Way  Existing Ground Survey  Signals  Geometry  Traffic Control  Geotechnical  Utilities  Landscaping  Walls
All basemap information shall be drawn in the Design model.    The location and dimensions of all plan view basemap design file information shall be drawn using real world dimensions at a 1:1 scale. A separate cross-section basemap should be used for each alignment in the project.  Cross sections shall be plotted in their own design file and never combined with any other basemap.  All basemap design files shall be stored in the appropriate discipline specific basemaps sub-directory and shall not be copied into another sub-directory for editing or referencing.
<em>1204.3.3.2 Sheet Design Files</em>
Sheet design files are used to assemble the plan sheets that are used for plotting a set of plans.    Sheet design files can be generated using ORD or OBM tools or generated manually using MicroStation reference tools.   When sheets are generated using the ORD or OBM tools, the Drawing model should be used to place all annotation for the sheet. The Sheet model contains the sheet border information and references the related drawing model(s).   When sheets are generated manually, the sheet design files are assembled by referencing Design models from the various basemap design files to the sheet model of the sheet file. Sheet border cells and annotation are typically placed in the sheet model.   Final plan sheets shall be in the Sheet Model. No items other than what is shown on the final plotted sheet can be shown in the Sheet Model.  Any detail shown in the final plotted sheet shall be represented at a 1:1 scale in either the Design model, Drawing model, or Sheet model of the corresponding file.    Each plan sheet shall be contained within the Sheet Model. Only one plan sheet per model is permissible for all file types, including cross sections. Users may elect to create multiple sheet models in a sheet design file. Only sheets of a like type are permitted in a multi-model sheet design file. For example, it is not permissible to create a design file containing the title sheet in one model and the schematic plan in a second model.    When sheet design files are submitted to the Department, no other graphics are permitted in the Sheet model other than the graphics representing the final plotted sheet.  All extra graphics used to generate the sheet, or old versions of the sheet, should be deleted or moved to a design model.  No extra reference attachments that are not a part of the final sheet are permitted to be attached to the sheet model.    To ensure that reference file attachments are maintained when moving project files from the original project directory to another location, references shall be attached using relative paths. The user shall not use MicroStation option to “Save Full Path” for reference attachments.
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
45
All completed sheet design files submitted to or exchanged with ODOT shall use references where applicable. Referenced graphics shall not be copied into the sheet files for the completed sheet design files submitted to ODOT.
1204.3.4 File Naming Conventions
1204.3.4.1 General  The efficient sharing and transfer of information from consultants/contractors to ODOT and vice versa relies on the use of a systematic file naming convention.  This section outlines a consistent, comprehensive file naming convention for graphic and associated files used in the CADD environment, which shall be used for all projects.   Standard naming conventions shall be used for all design files. Document all file names, both standard and project specific, in the Project Index file (For information on the Project Index File, see Section 1600, Electronic Design Deliverables. In the event a particular file type for the project is not addressed by this manual, use the file naming convention as a template for selecting an appropriate name or contact the Office of CADD and Mapping Services’ CADD Services section for assistance.   To avoid conflicting attachments of reference files, there shall be no duplicate file names within the project directory structure or copies of the same file within the project directory. It is not permissible to copy the same basemap design files into multiple discipline specific sub-directories. Submissions with duplicate file names will be rejected.
1204.3.4.2 File Extensions  Standard file name extensions for information submitted to, or exchanged with, ODOT shall be as follows:
File Type  Extension
Bentley Design File  .dgn  Bentley Cell Libraries  .cel  Portable Document Format  .pdf  Microsoft Word Documents  .doc or .docx  Microsoft Excel Spreadsheets  .xls or .xlsx  XML Files  .xml
For file types not listed above, the default file extension defined by the software shall be used.
<em>1204.3.4.3 File Name Format</em>
ODOT has defined the following naming convention to be used on all design files submitted to or exchanged with the Department.   Files shall be named as follows:
Design File Naming Format  nnnnnn_aa###.dgn    nnnnnn  =  Five (5) or Six (6) digit PID Number    aa  =  Two (2) letter code identifying the plan sheet type
(see Figure 1204-1 - File Name Type Codes)

<em>1204.3.4.4 Supplemental Description Guidelines</em>
ODOT allows users to provide supplemental description information by use of MicroStation’s File Properties. The intent of the supplemental description is to provide additional descriptive information to aid the designer in identifying a file.    The following properties are available in a MicroStation Design File: Title, Subject, Client, Keywords, and Comments.    For ODOT projects, the following properties should be used for design files submitted to or exchanged with the Department:
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
47
Title The Title property can be used to specify the file type description.  If used, the description shall correspond to the file descriptions for each file type shown in Figure 1204-1 - File Name Type Codes, prefixed with the Discipline name (see the examples on the following page).  Comments  The Comments property can be used to provide additional descriptive information to aid the designer in identifying a particular file. Comments are user definable with the following guidelines:
For Roadway design files the comment should start with the route name/number, where applicable, using the route name as follows:
IR###  Interstate route with three-digit number, e.g. IR071 for Interstate route 71.  US###  United State route with three-digit number, e.g. US033 for US route 33.  SR###  State route with three-digit number, e.g. SR315 for State route 315.  CR###  County Road with three-digit number, e.g. CR056 for County road 56.  RAMP###  Ramp with up to three-character name/number, e.g. RAMP2S for ramp 2-S.
ROADNAME  Road name, e.g. Paris for Paris road.  Note, directions (N, S, E, W) can be used on projects where plans exist for two different directions of the same roadway, e.g. Paris N for Paris road north.
Following the route name/number, the Comment property can contain additional information to help identify the specific sheet of the plan.    For Bridge design files, a brief description of the plan sheet contents should be included.

1204.3.5 Geographic Coordinate Systems
1204.3.5.1 General  A Geographic Coordinate System (GCS) is used to specify the position of the design contents on the earth´s surface. A library of standard GCSs is provided with MicroStation CE and ORD. Additionally, a custom system can be defined for ODOT projects mapped to ground coordinates.   The GCS shall be appropriately defined for all design files exchanged with the department.  See the Section 100 of the Location and Design Volume 4, Survey and Mapping Specifications, for information on positioning and control specifications.
1204.3.6 OpenRoads Designer
1204.3.6.1 Federated Files  OpenRoads data is stored in multiple discipline specific basemap design files as summarized below.
1204.3.6.1.1 Alignment Design Files  For projects with more than one alignment a federated file approach will be used, where each alignment is stored in its own design file, the BK Geometry Basemap. Each file is numbered consecutively using a three-digit number as detained in Section 1204.3.4.
1204.3.6.1.2 Corridor Modeling Design Files  Each OpenRoads corridor shall be stored in its own design file, the KM Corridor Modeling file. Each file is numbered consecutively using a three-digit number as detained in Section 1204.3.4.
1204.3.6.1.3 Survey Design Files  OpenRoads Survey information is processed in its own design file. (i.e., the FB basemap file). Each file is numbered consecutively using a three-digit number as detained in Section 1204.3.4.
1204.3.6.1.4 OpenRoads Drainage and Utilities Files  The OpenRoads Drainage and Utility commands require that a utility database is created in the design file. For this reason, subsurface utility information should be placed in its own design file (i.e., the BD basemap or the BU basemap file).
<em>1204.3.6.2 Alignment Names for OpenRoads Designer</em>
To facilitate the efficient sharing and transfer of Alignment information between consultants, ODOT, and contractors, the OpenRoads Designer Element Names detailed below have been established.   The following element names for horizontal and vertical alignments have been established for OpenRoads Civil Geometry elements.

1204.4 Plotting
1204.4.1 General
ODOT requires multi-page PDF files for plan submissions. PDF printing is facilitated using the MicroStation Print Organizer.    Print Organizer is a MicroStation utility for printing and reprinting a set of design files, models, or Project Explorer links. The files that are to be printed are saved as a print set, (PSET), file.     ODOT includes a template PSET file, OHDOT_seed.pset, prepopulated with folders to organize the design files that will make up the print. The PSET folder structure mimics the plan set structure from Section 1300. Additional directories can be added if needed. When the PDF is generated, the empty directories will not be included. The PSET folder names become multi-page PDF bookmarks.    In the OHDOT_Styles_Printing.dgnlib, Print Styles are defined that control the output from Print Organizer. Print Styles include ODOT standard Plot Configuration Files and Pen Tables and enable generation of PDF files as well as printed output. The OHDOT_Styles_Printing.dgnlib also defines a named expression, ODOT_SheetName, which can be applied to the plot set. This reads the model description from the model property and applies it to the name of the page in the PSET. The template PSET file uses this named expression as the default. If the Sheet Name in Model Properties is blank, then the Model Name from the Model Properties dialog is used as the default page name.     ODOT uses pen tables that are applied to the graphical elements when the design file is plotted. The pen tables translate various elements in the design file to the final output version.     Elements are plotted black and white but may be plotted in color if necessary to more easily depict certain plan features and/or if defined by the project scope.  The major grid level is set to a lower priority, so it will plot under most plan sheet details.  Cross section and profile grids should be plotted as shown in the Figure 1202-1.

1204.4.2 Plotting
MicroStation pen tables and Printer Driver Configuration files for use with MicroStation Connect and OpenRoads Designer are in the following workspace directory:   \OHDOTCEv02\Standards\Pltcfg\  The following briefly describes the Printer Configuration Files.   Printer Driver Files  Description  Default Page Size  OHDOT.pltcfg  Used for printing to windows print queue  17” x 11”  OHDOT_PDF.pltcfg  Used for printing in black to PDF file format  34” x 22”  OHDOT_PDF_Color.pltcfg  Used for printing in color to PDF file format  34” x 22”  OHDOT_PDF_Levels.pltcfg  Used for printing levels to PDF file format  34” x 22”
Pen Table Files  Description  OHDOT_Pen.tbl  Used to print in black  OHDOT_PenC.tbl  Used to print in color  OHDOT_UTPen.tbl Used to print utilities in color
Note: Elements not handled by the Shading or Masking sections of the OHDOT_Pen.tbl are plotted in black.  Elements not handled by the Shading or Masking sections of the OHDOT_PenC.tbl are plotted in color.
1204.4.2.1 Line Weights  The Printer Driver Files specify the MicroStation element weight to output line thickness. Line weights in the configuration files are defined as below for 22”x34” Prints. The configuration files set the Weight Scale to 0.5 for 11”x17” and 8 ½”x11” prints, so the thickness is one-half the values shown in the table. The Style Scale is also set to 0.5 for 11”x17” and 8 ½”x11” prints, reducing the dash and gap lengths of standard MicroStation line styles by one half. Though line thicknesses are defined to weight 10, only weights 0-5 are used in ODOT’s level standards:
Element Weight  Thickness (approximate inches)  WT = 0  0.006”  WT = 1  0.014”  WT = 2  0.026”  WT = 3  0.036”  WT = 4  0.046”  WT = 5  0.056”  WT = 6  0.066”  WT = 7  0.076”  WT = 8  0.086”  WT = 9  0.096”
WT = 10  0.106”
Due to the variation in plotting accuracy of various printers, the thicknesses shown in the table above can be modified as deemed necessary to achieve the desired results.

<em>1204.4.2.2 Priority and Transparency</em>
Plotting priorities are determined by the MicroStation level and the assigned element Priority values in the ODOT_Feature_Definitions.dgnlib. Priority and Transparency are not handled in the ODOT standard pen tables.
1204.4.2.3 Shading  The following functionality to shade various plan sheet elements is included in the OHDOT_Pen.tbl and OHDOT_PenC.tbl:  Cross Section Grid The pen table shade the Major Cross Section grid using the following settings:      Major Grid – uses Color = 42 (RGB Value = 176,176,176)  Shading Filled Shapes Shading levels were created to fill shapes with varying shades of Gray. The pen table fills shapes based on the following shading levels: SC_Shading1 – uses Color = 41 (RGB Value = 160, 160, 160) SC_Shading2 – uses Color = 43 (RGB Value = 192, 192, 192) SC_Shading3 – uses Color = 45 (RGB Value = 224, 224, 224)   Shading Reference(s) To gray shade a reference, the Logical Name must contain “gray”, for example gray1, gray2, etc. Color 41 (RGB Value = 160, 160, 160) is used to gray shade references. When plotting a reference using a logical name containing “gray”, the pen table will gray shade the entire reference.   Title Sheet Shading Corporation boundaries and route shields fill on the Title Sheet Area Map are handled in the pen table.
1204.4.2.4 Masking  Masking is an option to hide specific areas on a plan sheet. No elements will show underneath.  The Masking level plots all elements, or filled shapes, as White to mask any elements underneath. The pen table processes elements on the following masking level:   SH_Masking – uses Color = 255 (Background Color)
1204.4.2.5 Test Substitution  The pen tables handle text replacement on sheet borders to insert information such as file name, model name, date, time, etc.  The text replacement string is located on a sheet border on the left side.  See the table below for the text replacement settings.
Text String  Default Settings  `````  File Name, Model Name, Date, Time, Username  ``````  Model Name, Paper Size, Date, Time, Username  ```````  File Name

1204.4.2.6 Color Plotting  The OHDOT_PenC.tbl is used for producing color output of an ODOT plan sheet. This pen table does the Major Grids Line shading and Reference shading the same as above. Some text on the SH Data level is changed from White to Black by the pen table, so that it will display. Text substitution is handled as above. All other elements are plotted in their display colors.

<h4 id="section-1300-plan-components">Section 1300 Plan Components</h4>
<p>1301 Introduction  Plan development relies on standards and guidelines to provide clear, concise, and accurate construction documents. Detailed construction plans include illustrations of proposed work, plan notes, specifications, and quantities enabling contractors to bid and execute an ODOT project. Section 1300 has been developed to provide guidelines under which to develop ODOT construction plans.  Section 1300 combines many components of final plan development and outlines the content required in each plan set. The subsections listed within this document are intended to provide details related to plan format and not design standards. ODOT maintains specific manuals related to design standards (e.g. Bridge Design Manual, Location and Design Manual, Volume 1, Traffic Engineering Manual, etc.) which establish design criteria required for the facility.  Section 1300 includes references to figures and Sample Plans. The figures are tables, and diagrams, presenting plan sheet requirements and are referenced with bold text. The following is an example: Figure 1302-1.  The Sample Plans are examples of ODOT plan sheets (e.g., Title Sheet, Schematic, Typical Sections, etc.) and are intended to be used as a “guide” to assist the designer with plan development. The Sample Plans are not all-inclusive. Final plan development, in accordance with ODOT standards, is the responsibility of the designer. Structural plans (Bridge Design Manual) and Right-of-Way plans (Right-of-Way Manual) shall be developed according to their respective manuals. References to the Sample Plans are shown with brackets and bold text. The following is an example: [SP 1302-1].
1301.1 Standard Plans

On the Title Sheet, state the type of Geotechnical Explorations performed (e.g., Geotechnical Profile-Roadway, Geotechnical Profile-Bridge etc.) in accordance with Section 700 and Appendix D of the Specifications for Geotechnical Explorations. Include those sheets in the sequential numbering of the construction plan sheets.</li>
<li>Right-of-Way - These sheets are not included in the sequential numbering of the construction plan and should
be numbered separately. ─ Right-of-Way Legend Sheet ─ Centerline Plat ─ Property Map ─ Summary of Additional Right-of-Way ─ Detailed Right-of-Way</li>
<li>Railroad or Government Land Plats - These sheets are not included in the sequential numbering of the
construction plan and should be numbered separately.
1301.2 Simplified Plans
Simplified Plans are appropriate when the proposed work is simple and straightforward. Some examples include guardrail upgrading, pavement marking, herbicidal spraying, mowing, fencing, and resurfacing projects.  Simplified plans contain only the information necessary to minimally describe the type and location of the work. Typically, such plans consist of the following components:</li>
<li>Title Sheet [SP 1302-7]</li>
<li>Typical Sections
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
64</li>
<li>General Notes</li>
<li>General Summary, Subsummaries, Calculations</li>
<li>General plan, sketch, line drawing, or plan and profile</li>
<li>Special Details
Simplified plans may be used provided they give sufficient information to adequately describe the work so that a contractor can properly bid and construct the project. In some cases, this information can be presented entirely in written format, without the use of drawings. See Section 1315, Simplified Plans, for additional information regarding simplified plan content.
1302 Title Sheet
1302.1 General
The title sheet serves as a preface for the remainder of the construction plan. It gives a brief description and the length of the project, shows the general location of the project, sets up the specifications under which the project is to be built, states whether traffic is to be maintained or detoured, lists earth disturbed areas, gives an index of all sheets in the plan, lists standard construction drawings, railroad involvement, construction project number, federal project number, supplemental specifications, and special provisions, and contains the signature of approval by the proper officials.

All construction plans processed by the Ohio Department of Transportation must show in bold letters at the top of the Title Sheet, “STATE OF OHIO, DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION”.
1302.2.2 Project Designation
1302.2.2.1 Projects in One of Two Counties  A. On-System Projects - Projects on the State system are identified by county code, route number, and section number to the nearest hundredth of a mile (straight-line mileage). Following is an example [SP 1302-4] for a project in Wyandot County, on Route 30, beginning at straight-line mileage 9.11.
WYA-30-9.11  The county code consists of the first three letters of the county name with the following exceptions:
County Code
Ashland ASD
Ashtabula ATB
Champaign CHP
Harrison HAS
Meigs MEG
Monroe MOE

The route number is identical to the actual route number assigned to the highway on which the improvement is located. The section number is the straight-line mileage (SLM) at the point where the project begins, measured from the county line in miles from west to east for east-west routes or from south to north for north-south routes, as the route is viewed across the entire state.  Listed below are several special conditions which may be encountered in determining a project designation for a project on the State system.  County Line Located on Project Centerline The county code letters should be in accordance with the predetermined straight-line mileage assignment as listed in the Straight-Line Diagrams.  Project Limits Extend into Adjacent County A project designation must be shown for each county.
FRA-3-26.18, DEL-3-0.00  or  FRA/DEL-3-26.18/0.00
Work Limits Extend into Adjacent County The adjoining county code letters are shown in parentheses.
TUS-77-10.64(STA)
More than One Route (Not Overlapping) A separate project designation is used for each.
UNI-31-8.19, UNI-37-2.04  or  UNI-31/37-8.19/2.04
For projects with various work types on three or more routes and/or ramps that are all included in the work, the primary route number, and reference to the various routes, should be shown followed by the primary route SLM and reference to the secondary route(s) various SLMs, as shown:
MAH-224/VAR-13.62/VAR  Overlapping Routes - For projects on overlapping highways of different systems (Interstate, U.S. or State), only the project designation for the highest-classed system should be used.  For overlapping routes on the same system, the project designation for the lowest route number is used.
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
66
Intersecting Routes - A separate project designation is not required when other routes intersect the proposed improvement (junction or grade separation) unless it is determined that the intersecting route will have different funding than the principal route.  Suspended Projects - A separate straight-line mileage section number is used at the point where the project limit is resumed. The example below and [SP 1302-2] shows a project limit that begins at SLM 21.73, is suspended for a distance, and then is resumed at SLM 22.83. For additional information on how to determine project limits, see Section 1303.6.
DAR-121-(21.73) (22.33)  For instances where a project has numerous suspend/resume sections, the words “and various” may be used within the project designation, as shown as follows and in [SP 1302-5].
ERI-2-30.51 and various
B. Off System Projects - The project designation for improvements on county or township road systems include the county code, county or township route number, and local name (if any). A section number may also be included, if appropriate. [SP 1302-6(a)]
CRA-C.R. 6–1.61 (Boundary Rd.)  POR-T.R. 233D (Asbury Road)
If a route number is not available, city street improvements simply use the county code letters and the street name as the project designation. [SP 1302-1]

District-wide projects are defined as projects which involve work in three or more counties within the District. The project designation for a District-Wide project is as follows: District Identifier - Project Type - Fiscal Year. Following is an example project designation for a district-wide pavement marking plan, in District 4, that is scheduled to be awarded in the fiscal year 2016.
D04-PM-FY2016  There may be a need to have multiple projects of the same project type, in the same district, in one fiscal year. If this is the case, the project designation is as follows:
D04-PM-FY2016(A)  and  D04-PM-FY2016(B)
The following is a list of project types. Contact the Office of CADD and Mapping Services if another project type is needed.
1302.2.2.3 Statewide Projects   Statewide projects should use the same project designation as District-Wide projects, except the District Identifier is replaced with STW (Statewide). For example, STW-ITS-FY2017.
1302.2.3 Political Subdivisions
Whenever any work is located within a political subdivision, it is necessary to include the name of the subdivision. If the improvement is located entirely within the corporate limits of a city or village, the township name is omitted. The order of political subdivisions, from top to bottom is city, village, township, and county. If the work limits extend into an adjoining county, the county is shown in parentheses. The following example shows how a title would read when portions of the improvement are located within several political subdivisions and the work limits extend into the adjoining county.

OXFORD TOWNSHIP  TUSCARAWAS COUNTY  (STARK COUNTY)
1302.2.4 Railroads
When the improvement involves a railroad separation, the involvement must be indicated by a subtitle under the project designation [SP 1302-3].  Grade Crossing Elimination - When an existing railroad grade crossing is to be eliminated by constructing a separation or relocating the highway, the following subtitle should be used:   GRADE CROSSING ELIMINATION WITH THE ____________ RAILROAD  Separation Constructed Without Elimination - When the highway is to be separated from a railroad and the existing railroad grade crossing is not eliminated, use the following subtitle:   GRADE SEPARATION WITH THE                   RAILROAD  Existing Separation Rebuilt - When an existing separated crossing is to be rebuilt, the subtitle should read:
RECONSTRUCTION OF EXISTING SEPARATED CROSSING WITH THE                       RAILROAD        Projects which include grade separations or any other railroad involvement, should list the railroad company’s name in the Railroad Involvement portion of the title block.  It should be noted that some companies are incorporated as railroads and some as railways. Verify the proper name is placed on the title sheet.
1302.3 Design Designation
The Design Designation is an expression of the basic factors that control the design of the highway. It may be included in the plan for any type of construction project, but it is required on any improvement having pavement work or geometric changes.  Normally, only one representative Design Designation is necessary. On improvements involving interchanges, major intersections, or other major traffic generators that materially affect traffic volumes, additional Design Designations are required. Design designations are necessary for side roads if relocation, or significant improvements, equal to or greater than three-hundred feet (300’) are involved. If only one Design Designation is used, it should be shown on the Title Sheet. For improvements with multiple design designations (e.g., more than one route), this information may be shown on a sheet other than the Title Sheet (e.g., Schematic Plan, specially designated sheet).  However, the location of these sheet(s) must be noted in the Title Sheet’s Index of Sheets [SP 1302-5].  The following is an example of the Design Designation format [SP 1302-1 through 1302-6(b)]:
DESIGN DESIGNATION (ENGLISH UNITS)

Directional Distribution 55% Trucks (24 hour B&amp;C) 2.6% Td 4% Design Speed 50 MPH Legal Speed 40 MPH Design Functional Classification 03 Principal Arterial (Urban)
NHS Project Yes
Current ADT is the Average Daily Traffic for the anticipated opening year of the project.    Design year is defined in Location and Design Manual, Volume 1, Section 102.2.    Td is the percentage of trucks during the design hour in the design year, and is required for interstates, other freeways and expressways only.  Legal speeds are defined by the Ohio Revised Code in miles per hour.   If the project design is based on 3R [SP 1302-1] values the phrase “3R Project” should be used in lieu of the design speed. If a project mixes 3R work with other work that does not qualify as 3R, it is necessary to delineate or tabulate the non-3R portions and indicate the applicable design speeds.  Per the Ohio Department of Transportation Highway System Highway Functional Classification System – Concepts, Procedures, and Instructions, in addition to being classified as urban or rural, roadways are categorized as Principal Arterials, Minor Arterials, Collectors and Local Roads.  Additionally, Principal Arterials and Collectors are further subcategorized, creating a total of seven (7) classifications or sub-classifications as shown in the table below:
For more information on the Design Functional Classification please refer to the Location and Design Manual, Volume 1, Section 101, the Ohio Department of Transportation Highway Functional Classification System – Concepts, Procedures and Instructions, or contact the Office of Roadway Engineering.

1302.4 Design Exceptions
Design Exceptions are required as specified in Location and Design Manual, Volume 1, Section 105. The difference between the actual design and the normal design criteria must be clearly denoted on the appropriate plan sheet in the construction plans.  Design exceptions should be shown on the plan sheets in accordance with the guidelines on Figure 1302-3, Guide For Showing Design Exceptions in Plan, and on the Title Sheet [SP 1302-1] utilizing the following format:
DESIGN EXCEPTIONS
Design Feature
Approval Dates
Sheet Numbers
Lane Width 7/7/18 24 Bridge Width 7/7/18 46
If there are no design exceptions, indicate this by adding the words “None Required”. Contact the Office of Roadway Engineering with questions.
1302.5 Index of Sheets
The Index of Sheets serves as the table of contents for the entire set of plans. All sheets should appear in the index, sequentially numbered, except for as noted in 1301.1, Standard Plans. Geotechnical data from geotechnical reports may be included as Special Provisions on 8 ½ “x 11” sheets.  Since sheets are often added, deleted or rearranged during plan development, the final sheet numbering is usually deferred until the Stage 3 Review. To assist the reviewer in describing the location of review comments, sheets should be designated with numerical or alphabetical characters for each review submission.  As a last resort, sheets may be inserted into the plan by alphabetizing (Example: 88A, 88B, 88C, etc.). All alphabetized sheets must be shown in the Index of Sheets. The last actual sheet number in the plan is never alphabetized. [SP 1302-4]  Sheet numbers that are not used must be noted as “Not Used”.  [SP 1302-4]
1302.6 Plan Preparer Identification
1302.6.1 Signatures and Seals
All plans, including those prepared by ODOT staff, shall be digitally signed and sealed by a Registered Professional Engineer/Surveyor. Plans shall include a digital signature block and seal on the title sheet. Digital signatures and seals shall be applied in accordance with Ohio Administrative Code. More than one Engineer/Surveyor may seal the title sheet, or different Engineers/Surveyors may seal different portions of a plan (i.e., seal on bridge site plan to cover all bridge work). It must be clear what design elements each seal covers.  A single Engineer’s seal on the Title Sheet is assumed to cover the entire plan, unless otherwise noted.  Sample Plan Sheets [SP 1302-1 through 1302-8] show the normal placement of the Engineer’s seal.
1302.6.2 Design Firm Information
The name and address of the firm preparing the plan should be shown [SP 1302-1 through 1302-8].

1302.7 Underground Utilities Note
The “Before You Dig” warning note will be shown on the Title Sheet for all plans. The note is shown below and on the Sample Plan sheets [SP 1302-1 through 1302-8].
1302.8 Location Map
The Location Map [SP 1302-1 through 1302-8] shows the general area in which the project is located and the project limits. The map should be approximately 7&#34; x 7&#34;, for a full-size plan with North pointing toward the top of the sheet. A scale of 1&#34; = 1 mile is often used; however, the map scale shall be such that the limits of the project are clearly identified and the lettering clearly legible on an 11&#34;x17&#34; reduced set of plans.    The Location Map shall contain sufficient information to clearly show the location of the improvement with respect to federal, state, county and township roads; identifiable streets in urban areas; villages, cities, townships and counties; and rivers and creeks.   Detour routes should be shown on the Location Map [SP 1302-2], if possible. If not, the detour should be shown on the Schematic Plan, or Maintenance of Traffic Sheets [SP 1302-6(a)], and so noted in the Index of Sheets.  The latitude and longitude shall be provided for all projects, shall be measured to the center of the project, and shall be accurate to the nearest 5 seconds of a degree.    On multiple segment contracts, the latitude and longitude used shall be the approximate center of the segments of work. The approximate center can be established by visual inspection.  On district-wide contracts, the latitude and longitude used shall be the locations in the following table:

1302.9 Supplemental Specifications
A list of the Supplemental Specifications (including the current revision date) applicable to the project shall be included on the Title Sheet [SP 1302-1]. Supplements, 1000 series and above, are not to be listed on the Title Sheet.  Supplemental Specification 800 must be specified on all projects. Ensure that the most recent revision date, prior to the date of filing, of Supplemental Specification 800 is used.      A suffix indicating the applicable year of the specification book should be provided on the title sheet (i.e., when using the 2023 Construction and Material Specifications, Supplemental Specification 800-2023 should be used). The suffix is required because Supplemental Specification 800 will vary with each edition of the CMS.
1302.9.1 Special Provisions
When a special provision is needed for a project, the title and date of the special provision shall be listed on the Title Sheet [SP 1302-1].  See Section 1305.3 – Special Provisions for more information.
1302.10 Standard Construction Drawings
A list of current Standard Construction Drawings (including the current revision date) applicable to the project shall be included on the Title Sheet. The Title Sheet includes a table listing the Standard Drawings that apply to the project. During plan preparation, the drawings should be grouped by set, listed in alpha-numeric order within that set, and added to the Title Sheet [SP 1302-1].

1302.11 Project Description and Earth Disturbed Areas
1302.11.1 Project Description
The Project Description consists of a brief note describing the primary purpose of the improvement and the project’s length.    The project’s length is the total distance between the Begin and End project points, adjusted for suspensions and station equations, and measured along the centerline of construction. It is calculated to the nearest hundredth of a mile. In addition, the Project Description should describe other incidental construction. Incidental construction may include the following items (unless they are included in the primary construction): bridge work, interchanges, major connecting roads, lighting, traffic control, etc. The descriptions should use words and phrases such as: resurfacing of, widening and resurfacing of, reconstruction of, relocation of, construction of, rehabilitation of, replacement of, etc.

1302.11.2 Earth Disturbed Areas
For all projects, list the Project Earth Disturbed Area and the Estimated Contractor Earth Disturbed Area in acres to the tenth of an acre. For projects that require the submittal of a Notice of Intent (NOI), as explained in the Location and Design Manual, Volume 2, Section 1109, list the Notice of Intent (NOI) Earth Disturbed Area to the tenth of an acre. For projects with non-contiguous portions of earth disturbance located ¼ mile or more apart, list the separate non-contiguous earth disturbance area values in separate tables.  For projects involving no disturbed area, such as pavement marking, provide the estimated Project and Contractor EDA, but indicate that a Notice of Intent (NOI) is not required. Use the approach shown in the following example description:
Project Earth Disturbed Area = 0.0 Acres  Estimated Contractor Earth Disturbed Area = 0.0 Acres  Notice of Intent Earth Disturbed Area = N/A (NOI not required)  For projects involving some earthwork, but less than one acre of total earth disturbed area (EDA) (e.g., small bridge replacement), provide the estimated Project and Contractor EDA, to the tenth of an acre, but indicate that a Notice of Intent (NOI) is not required. Use the approach shown in the following example description:    Project Earth Disturbed Area = 0.5 Acres  Estimated Contractor Earth Disturbed Area = 0.2 Acres  Notice of Intent Earth Disturbed Area = N/A (NOI not required)  For projects that require a Notice of Intent (NOI), provide the estimated Project and Contractor EDA, as well as the Total EDA, called the Notice of Intent EDA to the tenth of an acre. Use the approach shown in the following example description: [SP 1302-1]   Project Earth Disturbed Area = 3.1 Acres  Estimated Contractor Earth Disturbed Area = 0.5 Acres  Notice of Intent Earth Disturbed Area = 3.6 Acres  For routine maintenance projects, per the Location and Design Manual, Volume 2, Section 1109.2, provide the estimated Project and Contractor EDA to the tenth of an acre, but indicate that a Notice of Intent (NOI) is not required.  Use the approach shown in the following example description: [SP 1302-7]   Project Earth Disturbed Area = 4.0 Acres  Estimated Contractor Earth Disturbed Area = 0.1 Acres  Notice of Intent Earth Disturbed Area = N/A (NOI not required) *  * Routine Maintenance Project

When additional signatures are desired, such as those for city or county officials, they shall be placed on the signature sheet prior to submission of final tracings, Figure 1302-2.
1302.14 Combined Plans
When construction plans for two or more projects are combined to be sold as one construction project, the following Title Sheet [SP 1302-6(a), SP 1302-6(b)] changes should be made:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Add “Part 1” after the project designation on the first title sheet.  Add “Part 2”, “Part 3”, etc. to each succeeding
plan title sheet.</li>
<li>Cross reference all parts on all title sheets.  For example, on the first title sheet for a three-part project, add “For Part 2 see                 ” and “For Part 3 see                 .”</li>
<li>Expand the Standard Construction Drawings, Supplemental Specification and Special Provisions lists on the
Part 1 title sheet to include those required for all parts. Remove Standard Construction Drawing, Supplemental Specification and Special Provisions lists from all subsequent title sheets and add a cross-reference to Part 1.
In addition to the above title sheet changes, the type of Field Office specified in each plan should be adjusted to provide for the combined construction costs; and the maintenance of traffic should be coordinated for all parts.    During the design phase of a project that will use Combined Plans, two or more separate PIDs may be established to reference each Part of the project. However, the construction contract must utilize only one PID. Update Ellis to provide cross-references that correlate the design phase and construction PIDs.
Items 614, 619, 623, and 624 should be provided on all parts where they are applicable.
1302.15 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Design Waivers
ADA Design Waivers are required as specified in the Multimodal Design Guide, Section 4.5.9.7. ADA Design Waivers shall be shown on the Title Sheet utilizing the following format [SP 1302-1]:
ADA DESIGN WAIVER:  None Required       ADA DESIGN WAIVER:  Required

1302.17 Federal Project Number
The Federal Project Number should be entered in the appropriate space on the title sheet. If the project has no federal participation, the words “Non-Federal” should be entered in this space.
1303 Schematic Plan
1303.1 General
The purpose of a Schematic Plan [SP 1303-1] is to show the geometric location of proposed roadway segments in relation to existing roadway segments and other features. All projects shall include a Schematic Plan unless the project is short enough to be shown entirely on less than four Plan &amp; Profile sheets.   Schematic Plans are normally prepared to a scale of 1&#34;=100&#39;, 1&#34;=200&#39;, or 1&#34;=400&#39;. It is preferable to limit the Schematic Plan to one sheet.  The scale shall be shown in bar format.  Many of the features included on a Schematic Plan are discussed in the following sections. Other features may be added, as necessary, to provide a clearer picture of the proposed improvement and its relationship to existing facilities.
1303.2 Reference Lines
All reference lines should be clearly shown on the Schematic Plan [SP 1303-1]. These include the centerline of construction, baselines of ramps, directional roadways and other similar facilities. The centerline of construction and centerline of Right-of-Way should normally be the same. When they differ, their relationship to each other must be shown in the plan. Typically, the relationship is only shown on the Right-of-Way plan sheets.  With modern survey technology, topographic surveys are no longer completed based on a centerline of survey. Consequently, survey centerlines are a misnomer and should not be shown.  The intersection angle, as well as the intersecting stations, should be shown for all intersecting roadways. It may be more convenient to show this information on an intersection detail.
1303.3 Stationing
In general, tick marks shall be shown at full stations (100 ft. intervals) along the center and base reference lines. The centerline stationing on a project should reflect the straight-line mileage shown on the “section” (County-Route-Section). Centerline stationing may also be established based on existing monumentation, bridges and prior projects. Stationing shall increase in the direction of the straight-line mileage.  The Schematic Plan should generally be oriented in such a manner that the stationing on the mainline will increase from left to right, regardless of the north direction [SP 1303-2].  Ramp stationing should be a continuation of mainline stationing from the exit or entrance nose and should increase or decrease along the ramp as it does along the mainline.  In general, it is not desirable to use ramp stations in the terminal area, as the required pavement slopes and transitions can be laid out using the mainline stations.  Station equations, if necessary, are to be indicated on the reference line by stating the station back and station ahead [SP 1303-3].

If the basis for centerline stationing is unclear or there is a lack of monumentation, structures or prior project stationing documentation, the designer establishing the centerline stationing shall coordinate with the District Survey Section and/or District Real Estate Section to determine the appropriate basis for centerline stationing.
1303.4 Bearings
Bearings shall be shown for the tangent sections of all reference lines.
1303.5 Horizontal Curve Data
Horizontal curve data, and deflections without curves, for all existing and proposed alignments must be shown on the Schematic Plan. Figures 1303-1 through 1303-3 show elements and data for simple curves, spiral curves, and for when combining spirals between two simple curves. Curve data (except angles) should be shown to two decimal place accuracy. Deflections without curves are identified as follows:
P.I. = Sta. _______________
Deflection = ______________
NO CURVE       Use “emax = NC” to indicate that normal crown is provided.
1303.6 Project Limits
<em>Project limits are points on the mainline centerline of construction where the proposed improvement, as described in the project description on the Title Sheet (excluding incidental construction), begins and ends. Project limits are generally defined as the beginning/ending of proposed full-depth, full-width pavement.  Incidental construction includes all work required to complete a project in addition to the primary purpose for the improvement. Work such as pavement feathering and tapering, traffic control devices, drainage, guardrail, drives, side roads, service roads, etc., may be considered as incidental construction and not be included in the project limits.  Where the primary work on the mainline is suspended for a substantial distance, suspend and resume project points must also be shown.    Begin Project, End Project, Suspend Project, and Resume Project points shall be shown on the Schematic Plan and the Plan &amp; Profile sheets and include both stationing and straight-line mileage (SLM).</em>
1303.7 Work Limits
Work Limits are the extreme limits of the contractor’s responsibility on a project, including all temporary and incidental construction, with the exception of work zone traffic control devices required for maintenance of traffic. Work Limit stations are shown along the centerline of construction of the mainline facility and along the centerline of all side roads, crossroads, and other construction generally running perpendicular to the project or separated from the project.
1303.8 Federal Project Flags
Federal Project Flags, including Federal Project numbers, should be placed at the project limits [SP 1303-2]. The flags shall always point toward the project. If more than one Federal number is used, the limits of each Federal number should be shown, again pointing to the portion of the project to which it applies.
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
79
1303.9 Political Boundaries
All county, township, corporation limits, and other political boundaries shall be labeled. The station where these boundaries intersect the centerline of construction shall be shown. When the political boundary is located along the centerline, stationing shall be shown at the points where the political boundary meets and leaves the centerline.
1303.10 Waterways
All waterways (lakes, rivers, streams, jurisdictional ditches, creeks, ponds, etc.), crossing or adjacent to the proposed improvement, shall be shown, labeled, and the direction of flow shall be indicated. This includes any relocated waterways. See Office of Environmental Services’ Waterway Permits Manual for more information on waterways.
1303.11 Bridges
All bridges, existing and proposed, shall be shown at their appropriate location and identified by their structure number, including left and right notation.
1303.12 Roads for Maintaining Traffic
The location of all roads for maintaining traffic located on an independent alignment shall be shown. Roads for maintaining traffic may be shown using centerline only.
1303.13 Railroads
All railroads in the vicinity of the proposed improvement shall be shown. If a railroad intersects the highway, the station shall be indicated.
1303.14 Utility Lines
High voltage power lines and other major overhead utilities shall be shown. High pressure underground utility lines shall also be shown. Include size/voltage and ownership for these lines [SP 1303-3].
1303.15 Pipelines
All major pipelines shall be located and shown.
1303.16 Service/Public Roads
All existing and proposed service roads and other public roads shall be shown and identified by the name and number.
1303.17 Culverts and Sewers
All existing and proposed culverts shall be shown at their appropriate location and the size indicated.  Include flow arrows showing direction of flow in the culvert. List the structure number for any structure on the State/Federal system having a span greater than or equal to 10 feet.  Outfall sewers shall be shown.  Drive pipes do not need to be shown.
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
80
1303.18 Landscaped Areas
All existing and proposed landscaped areas should be shown. If no landscaped areas exist, then include the phrase “There are no existing landscaped areas within the work limits.”
1303.19 Participation Splits
All participation split locations shall be shown. Participation splits are necessary when portions of the project are financed under different Federal Project Numbers, are split by municipal corporation lines, or there are areas to be paid for by only one agency.
1303.20 Contractor’s Use of ODOT Right-of-Way
On large projects it may be economical for the Department to permit the contractor to use ODOT property to dispose of waste material and construction debris, excavate borrow material or place a portable plant.    These areas should be checked to ensure that their use is in keeping with all design criteria, environmental regulations and public involvement commitments. When evaluating an area for waste material, the designer should consider future widening and the location of underground utilities.  Areas where the above activities are permissible should be identified in the plans (e.g., on the schematic plan, on the plan and profile sheets, on the cross-sections, in a plan note). Grading restrictions should be identified on the cross sections or specified in the General Notes. Unless additional requirements are provided in the plans, there are no limits on the type of waste material that can be used (e.g., plant material, stumps, etc.). The plan should show whether environmental and/or FEMA permits have been obtained or if the contractor is required to obtain them.
1303.21 Wetlands
All existing wetlands within 100 feet of the proposed construction limits shall be shown and labeled.  Wetlands are located and delineated as per the Office of Environmental Services Ecological Manual.
1303.22 Project Control and Reference Points
All necessary survey/mapping parameters should be conveyed in the General Notes as established in Sample Plan Note G105, in Appendix B. Points used to establish project control and reference points should be shown in the Schematic Plan [SP 1303-1] or listed in the General Notes [SP 1305-1].  The survey/mapping for all projects should be developed utilizing the ODOT Survey and Mapping Specifications which are found in the Location and Design Manual, Volume 4, Section 2000, and the Office of CADD and Mapping Services website.    A table listing project control and reference information such as the primary project control monuments, azimuth marks and/or temporary benchmarks (see Section 2000 of the Location and Design Volume 4 Manual, Survey and Mapping Specifications, for descriptions of these items) should be provided. The following information should be included:</li>
<li>Point number</li>
<li>Grid and scaled coordinates in U.S. Survey feet (northing/easting)</li>
<li>Orthometric Height (Elevation)</li>
<li>Description (i.e. Primary Project Control - steel rod set in concrete)
See [SP 1305-1] for an example of the project control table.

1304 Typical Sections
1304.1 General
The Typical Section is a portrayal, with dimensions, of how a cross-sectional view of the roadway would appear after construction is completed. Except in the case of some ramps, typical sections should be shown relative to the direction of increasing stationing regardless of the direction of travel. Sections should generally be drawn to the same scale horizontally and vertically, although the vertical scale of the pavement thickness may be exaggerated to show the thickness of the various layers. The scale should be large enough to clearly show the proposed section, as well as existing features. No scale should be shown on the typical section. Although sections on the same sheet are usually drawn to the same scale, enlarged details may be used to show items such as pavement edge treatment. Ground lines, existing pavement and all other existing features should be shown (if relevant) using dashed lines.  Mainline, ramp and other roadway typical sections should be grouped together.  Most of the features included in the Typical Sections are discussed in the following sections. Other features may be necessary to cover special circumstances. Examples are included in the Sample Plan Sheets.
1304.2 Typical Section Type and Limits
Unless they have identical typical sections, separate sections must be shown for the mainline, side roads, crossroads, ramps, and other roadways involving paving or earthwork. The typical section of the adjoining pavement including type, thickness, and cross slopes of all pavement courses should be provided.    Sections should be shown for each roadway when: the pavement build-up changes, the type of median changes, guardrail and concrete barriers begin or end, lanes are added or dropped (minimum and maximum limits are sufficient), and in superelevated areas. Separate sections and lane widths are not required for intersections.  Varying pavement widths in intersection return areas should also be disregarded. A reference to the sheet containing the intersection detail may be added, if necessary. Each section must be adequately labeled to indicate if it is a normal or superelevated section and the roadway and station limits where it applies. Partial sections may be applicable for: changes in treated shoulder build-up; shoulder slope changes in superelevated sections; cut and fill slopes; and other similar situations.  Special sections may be required for speed change lanes, approach slabs, linear grading, etc. Typical sections should also be shown where pavement composition is adjusted over culverts with shallow fill.  Under each section, the station limits where the typical section is applicable shall be indicated. Calculation of the lengths where these typicals apply is not necessary.  Limiting stations for side road typical sections shall break at the side road stations of the extended mainline edges of pavement.
1304.3 Reference Line Location
The location of the centerline or baseline of construction must be shown on each typical section.
1304.4 Rounding
Rounding of slopes shall be shown on each typical section where applicable.
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
82
1304.5 Profile Grade Point
The location of the profile grade elevation (normally the crown point) shall be noted on each typical section.  Its location should be clearly identified. On a divided highway the profile grade for both sides shall be shown. When the crown-line and profile-grade line are not the same [SP 1304-5], their relationship to each other must be shown.
1304.6 Dimensions
Items on each typical section shall be dimensioned. All dimensions must be shown either in a vertical or horizontal plane. None are to be measured along slope lines. When referring to items detailed in the Standard Construction Drawings, dimensions may be omitted.  If a dimension varies within the limits of a typical section, it should be noted as “varies”, the maximum and minimum dimensions within the limits shall be identified. The limits shall be clearly shown, either on the Typical Section, the Plan and Profile Sheet, or other appropriate detail sheet.  Vertical dimensions include pavement course thicknesses, edge thicknesses, underdrain depths, ditch depths, etc.  Where variations in a pavement course thickness are proposed, the typical section should show the thickness as “varies” and the variations shown in tabular form. Vertical dimensions shall normally be in inches.  Horizontal dimensions include widths of pavement, graded shoulders, treated shoulders, steps at edges of pavements, ditches, sidewalks, approach slabs, rounding, pavement widening, medians, barrier offsets, etc. On projects with multilane configurations or curbed shoulders, the lane locations and widths should be shown. Variations in horizontal dimensions due to intersections, etc. should not be included in the typical section. They should be clearly shown on the pertinent plan detail sheets. Horizontal dimensions shall normally be in tenths of a foot.
1304.7 Pavement and Shoulder Cross-Slopes
The shape of the finished surface of the pavement and shoulders should be shown on each typical section by indicating the direction (by an arrow pointing downslope) and the rate of slope. Cross-slopes on pavements and shoulders are to be expressed in dimensionless, vertical-to-horizontal ratios, in decimal form (e.g. 0.01, 0.016, 0.08, etc.).
1304.8 Subsurface Drainage
The location of pipe underdrains, aggregate drains, etc. should be shown on each typical section. Include slopes for aggregate drains. See the Pavement Design Manual, Section 205 - Subsurface Pavement Drainage for guidance.
1304.9 Pavement Build-Up
Pavement and treated shoulder build-ups and course steps shall be clearly indicated on each typical section.  This includes such items as: surface, base and subbase courses; curb, curb and gutter; saw cuts; depth of planning; pavement for maintaining traffic to remain, etc.  Step details may be needed to adequately show pavement “steps” as per the Pavement Design Manual.
1304.10 Foreslopes and Backslopes
If the limiting stations of a typical section include both cuts and fills, examples of each should be shown. Cut and fill foreslope and backslope rates shall be indicated as 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, (horizontal: vertical) etc. Percentages should not be used. Guardrail offset locations shall also be shown, where applicable.
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
83
1304.11 Legend
The legend is required to describe the pay items used in the Typical Sections and the build-up of the existing pavement.  It may be shown on only the first Typical Section sheet with a cross-reference shown on each succeeding sheet. Numbered or lettered balloons are used to tie the legend to the drawings. Proposed items are to be differentiated from existing by using numbers for proposed and letters for existing. In addition, dashed balloons may be used to show existing items. Balloon references should be consistent throughout the typical section sheets.  The legend for proposed items shall include the specification number and the exact pay item description, as listed in the ODOT Item Master. The legend for existing items should never include a specification number but should describe the item in more generic terms such as:  Asphalt Concrete, Reinforced Concrete, or Subbase. The approximate existing depth (+/-) should be listed.
1304.12 Longitudinal Joints
For rigid pavements, the location and type of all longitudinal joints should be indicated on each typical section [SP 1304-3].
1304.13 Approach Slabs
Although approach slabs are paid for as structure items, base pavement, cross slopes, etc. must be shown on the typical sections.
1304.14 Warranty Pavement
When warranty pavement is included in a project, show the total thickness of the pavement along with an assumed configuration.
1304.15 Subgrade Treatment
Subgrade treatments such as lime stabilization, cement stabilization or undercuts are to be shown on the typical sections and the cross sections.  Illustrate the subgrade treatment on the cross-sections with a distinct hatching pattern. Provide a legend on the cross-sections indicating the proposed subgrade treatment type and depth.
1305 General Notes and Special Provisions
1305.1 General
The General Notes contain those plan notes required to clarify construction items that are not satisfactorily covered by the specifications or plan details. They are also used to modify the Standard Construction Drawings. All pay items that are “As Per Plan” or “Item Special” require a plan note, a special detail, or both.  On small projects, the General Note Sheets will include the majority of all plan notes for the project. For large projects, components such as Maintenance of Traffic, Sanitary Sewers, Water Work, Traffic Control, Lighting, Landscaping or Structures should be accompanied by their own plan notes.  Plan notes are to be consistent with the intent and requirements of the plans. Notes that repeat provisions clearly covered by the Construction and Material Specifications, Supplemental Specifications or Standard Construction
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
84
Drawings should be avoided. For unusual or potentially controversial plan notes, contact the involved specification committee chair for advice on the content of the note.  Sample Plan Sheet [SP 1305-1] shows an example General Note format.  Specific notes must be selected by the project designer.  Notes may be block justified as shown in [SP 1305-1]; or left justified as shown in [SP 1306-1].
1305.2 Special Provisions
Special Provisions are notes and/or specifications developed for a project that are not related to standard ODOT Construction and Material Specifications. Ordinarily, these notes should be included in the General Notes. However, when these notes would take up a significant number of plan sheets, the designer may opt to include them with the plan as Special Provisions produced on 8-1/2” x 11” sheets.   In the case of Waterway Special Provisions, the Office of Environmental Services (OES) provides Special Provisions in the form of Waterway Permit conditions, which includes the conditions of the Section 404 permits and the OEPA Section 401 Water Quality Certifications. The actual 404/401 permits are sent by OES to the district office to be displayed on the project site.   The title and date of all Special Provisions are listed on the Title Sheet. A reproducible letter size copy of all Special Provisions is to be included in the Final Plan Package submitted to the Office of Estimating.
1306 Maintenance of Traffic
1306.1 General
Maintenance of Traffic sheets normally follow the General Notes. On projects where traffic maintenance is uncomplicated or traffic is detoured, a separate Maintenance of Traffic section of the plan is not required, and the notes may be included with the General Notes. When bridge plans include staged construction details, a cross-reference to these details should be added to the Maintenance of Traffic notes.  Examples of Maintenance of Traffic sheets are included in the Sample Plan Sheets [SP 1306-1 through SP 1306-8].
1306.2 Maintenance of Traffic Plan Contents
Probably the least complicated plans for maintaining traffic result when through traffic is detoured during the entire construction period. In such cases, the detour route is shown on the Title Sheet Location Map [SP 1302-2], Schematic Plan, General Notes or on a separate detour sheet [SP 1306-3].  If the detour is shown somewhere other than on the Title Sheet Location Map, it should be referenced in the Index of Sheets.  When traffic is maintained during construction, the plan will normally require a number of notes along with several details. The following is a list of some of the details that may be required:</li>
<li>Sequence of operations [SP 1306-1 and SP 1306-2].</li>
<li>Phase drawings showing construction by phase [SP 1306-4(a) through 1306-8], method of maintaining
traffic for each phase, barriers, drums, maintenance of traffic signing, existing signing, and pavement marking. Phasing plans may be drawn at 1”=20’, 1”=30’, 1”=40’, 1”=50’, 1”=100’ or 1”=200’.</li>
<li>Section details for maintaining traffic, showing existing pavement widths, pavement for maintaining traffic
widths (including guardrail offset and grading), lateral construction limits, placement of channeling devices (barriers, drums, etc.) and work zone lane widths.
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
85</li>
<li>Supplemental details for work zone traffic control devices.</li>
<li>Plan insert sheets Crossover details</li>
<li>Roads / Pavement for maintaining traffic details</li>
<li>Miscellaneous MOT details
The Traffic Engineering Manual provides guidance on how to maintain traffic during construction and gives specific details on what is required on maintenance of traffic sheets.  For additional information regarding Maintenance of Traffic, contact the Office of Roadway Engineering.
1306.3 Roads and Pavements for Maintaining Traffic
A temporary road is a road whose sole purpose is to temporarily maintain traffic during construction, after which it is normally removed. Temporary roads are constructed using Item 615, Roads for Maintaining Traffic and Item 615, Pavement for Maintaining Traffic.  Item 615, Roads for Maintaining Traffic is a lump sum quantity that includes all embankment and excavation necessary to construct and remove the temporary road. When undercuts are necessary for permanent mainline pavement or embankment construction, the proposed temporary road should be evaluated for undercuts. A geotechnical evaluation should be considered to determine if the existing soil conditions are adequate to support the temporary road. Additional soil borings along the temporary road are not normally required to make the geotechnical evaluation.  Item 615, Pavement for Maintaining Traffic is paid for by the square yard and includes the necessary pavement for the temporary road as per CMS 615.05. When the pavement build-up differs from that shown in CMS 615.05, Item 615, Pavement for Maintaining Traffic, As per Plan, shall be used with the pavement build-up as shown in the plans.  Sample Plan Sheets [SP 1306-6 and 1306-7] show details such as alignment, grade, typical sections, cross-sections, and superelevation that are typically required for a temporary road on independent alignment.  Independent alignments should be drawn at 20’=1” [20:1] or 50’=1” [50:1].  When the earthwork required to maintain traffic is relatively small, a plan note can be used to indicate that the earthwork required to construct the temporary road will be included as part of Item 615, Pavement for Maintaining Traffic, As Per Plan and not paid for separately under Item 615, Roads for Maintaining Traffic. [SP 1306-4(a)] shows an example of when it may be beneficial to combine the two quantities.  Item 615, Pavement for Maintaining Traffic should not be confused with items such as 410, 441, and 616 which may also be included in the plans to be used for maintenance of traffic. Nor should it be confused with the pavement quantities listed in the Local Alternate Detour note.
1307 Estimated Quantities
1307.1 General
Quantities shall be calculated and presented in the plan in such a manner that they may be traced from the General Summary sheet to their origin through a system of cross-referencing. Sample Plan sheets [SP1307-1 through 1307-6] provide examples of Subsummary and General Summary formats.
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
86
The General Summary for all projects is required to be in an Excel format using the standard spreadsheet, CTY-PID-GENSUM.xlsm, available on the CADD Services’ external webpage. This excel spreadsheet is used to transfer all plan quantities directly into the Office of Estimating’s AASHTOWare software to create proposals for advertising and bidding.   The spreadsheet can be copied, or linked, to a CADD file containing a standard sheet border for inclusion in the plan images set, or for printing purposes.
1307.2 General Summary Sheet
1307.2.1 Sheet Number Columns
The sheet number columns are used to show a cross-reference to the sheet from which the quantities are carried. Extra columns should be provided to allow for possible additions. Quantities may originate from many sources, and these sources may often exceed the number of columns available on the General Summary. For this reason, subsummaries are often used. Subsummaries are described in more detail in Section 1307.3.
1307.2.2 Participation and Funding Splits
To facilitate project accounting, pay quantities should be separated in the General Summary and throughout the plans according to participation by the involved agencies [SP 1307-4 and 1307-5]. This usually applies to situations where portions of the project are financed under different federal project numbers, are split by municipal corporation lines, or contain items that are to be paid for by only one agency. The General Summary should show a separate subtotal for each unique combination of Local, State and Federal fund participation, including subtotals for all Incidental pay items, in addition to the grand total. Funding splits for projects using combined funds (e.g. Bridge and Safety) shall also show separate subtotals for each unique combination of funding, in addition to the grand total in the General Summary. When participation or funding splits are needed for a project, the participation or funding split columns are to be included on all sheets of the General Summary.    In lieu of creating separate columns in the General Summary, the use of an asterisk to identify items with participation or funding splits is allowable for projects with one or two affected items. A note associated with the asterisk shall provide details regarding the participation or funding split.  Pavement Quantities listed under the “Office Calcs” column on the General Summary should reflect participation or funding splits when needed.  If space permits, extra columns should be provided on the General Summary to permit additional participation or funding splits.
1307.2.3 Item Code, Unit of Measure, and Description
The ODOT Item Master is a listing of construction item codes, their corresponding pay item descriptions, and units of measure. This list is continually updated and posted on the Office of Estimating’s website. Questions regarding the ODOT Item Master should be directed to the Office of Estimating.  The item code is a nine-character identifier used to catalogue pay item descriptions into a computerized database. All item codes and descriptions must be written exactly as listed in the Item Master. The first three digits of the item code generally refer to the specification number of the pay item and are entered in the “Item” column on the General Summary. The last five digits of the item code (referred to as the “Item Extension”) are used to catalogue the pay items within the specification number. The item extension is entered in the “Item Extension” column. The fourth character refers to the type of measurement being used (“E” for English) and should not be included in the item code on the General Summary. It will be added at the time the information is entered into the computer during final plan processing.
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
87
Item Specials are an exception to the above and are discussed in Section 1307.2.6 – “Standard”, “As Per Plan”, “Miscellaneous”, and “Special” Pay Items. Item extensions are to be shown on the General Summary only (not subsummaries, notes, etc.).  Water work items using city specifications are to be Item “Specials” and their descriptions are to be per ODOT’s Item Master. Refer to the Item Master page on the Office of Estimating’s website for guidance.   Item descriptions are limited to an additional 120 characters beyond those shown in the Item Master.  Lump sum items shall show ”LS” in the Grand Total column with the Unit column left blank.  Supplemental descriptions are occasionally required for standard items and are always required for miscellaneous items.  Refer to the “Special Instruction” column in ODOT’s Item Master for a list of items requiring a supplemental description. Spaces, colons, and/or semicolons are not to be placed before a supplemental description, nor is the supplemental description to be placed within quotation marks.  The various items of work are grouped in order in the General Summary under the following headings:   Roadway  Erosion Control  Environmental / Remediation  Drainage  Pavement  Water Work  Sanitary Sewer  Lighting  Electrical  Other Utilities  Traffic Surveillance  Traffic Control  Traffic Signals  Landscaping  Retaining Walls (Identifying Information)  Building Demolition  Noise Barriers  Structures:  Structure Repair (Bridge Number and SFN)  Structure 20 Foot Span and Under (Bridge Number and SFN)  Structure Over 20 Foot Span (Bridge Number and SFN)  Miscellaneous Structure  Maintenance of Traffic   Items of Work  Engineering and Surveying Services  Incidentals  Alternate, optional, and additive alternate bid items shall be listed under separate headings that are modified from the headings listed.  Alternate bid items shall be listed in the General Summary under a separate heading selected from the headings listed in this section, followed by the word “ALTERNATES” (e.g., ROADWAY ALTERNATES, DRAINAGE ALTERNATES, etc.), and placed directly after its corresponding heading section. For more information, see Section 1307.2.7 – Alternate, Optional, and Additive Alternate Bid Items and Sample Plan Sheet [SP 1307-4].
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
88
As with alternate bid items, optional bid items shall also be listed in the General Summary under a separate heading selected from the headings listed in this section, with each set of optional bid items grouped together and designated with an alphabetical label (e.g., OPTION A, OPTION B, etc.) added to the heading. The heading shall be followed by a brief description and placed in alphabetical order directly after its corresponding heading section. For more information, see Section 1307.2.7 – Alternate, Optional, and Additive Alternate Bid Items and [SP1307-3(c)].
Additive alternate bid items shall be listed in the General Summary under an “ADDITIVE ALTERNATE” heading followed by a numerical label (e.g. 1, 2, etc.). The heading shall be followed by a brief description and placed in numerical order directly before the incidental pay items. For more information, see Section 1307.2.7 – Alternate, Optional, and Additive Alternate Bid Items and Sample Plan Sheet [SP1307-3(d)].

A Bridge Number is the SLM of the structure, written without the decimal point (i.e., MER-707-1692L&amp;R or HIG-TR607-0168). The SFN is the Structure File Number that uniquely identifies a bridge.  Three-sided culverts must be listed as separate structures. Prefabricated structures with spans greater than or equal to 10 feet should be listed as structure items. Prefabricated structures with spans less than 10 feet should be included with the drainage items. Work that may require a sub-contractor may have a separate summary, or subsummary, unless very few items are involved. Examples are Water Work, Lighting, Traffic Control, Traffic Signals, Landscaping, Retaining Walls and Structures. When a separate summary is used, a cross reference must be shown on the General Summary to the sheet numbers on which the quantities are listed. A separate summary is usually provided for Sanitary Sewer items, although these items may be included under Drainage if the sanitary work involves only minor adjustments.  Building Demolished is often considered a Roadway item when only a few buildings are involved. To facilitate the collection of data for reports required by FHWA, Structures are divided into four categories: Structure Repair, Structure 20 Foot Span and Under, Structure Over 20 Foot Span, and Miscellaneous Structure.  The General Summary shall be required in an Excel format using the standard spreadsheet, CTY-PID-GENSUM.xlsm.   More information on the use of the CTY-PID-GENSUM.xlsm spreadsheet can be found in Section 1307.1 and on the Office of Estimating’s website.  The pay items within each of the listed headings must be arranged in ascending numerical order by the item code. For items with the same item code but different supplemental descriptions, the items are placed in alpha-numeric order by supplemental description. As a general rule, at least one blank line should be left between every five pay items to provide for possible additions.  Pay items should be included under each heading as per the following list. Unless otherwise noted, all items under the stated specification number are included.  Roadway - 201, 202 (except Structure Removed, Portions of Structure Removed, Approach Slab Removed, and Building Demolished), 203 (except when used for mechanically stabilized earth walls), 204, 205, 206, 208, 209, 606 (except Noise Barrier), 607, 608, 622 (except Portable Barrier), 623 (except Construction Layout Stakes and Surveying), 625 (Ground Rod for fence), 651, 652, 653, 654, 656, 690 (pertinent pay items), 862, 863, 871, 878.  Erosion Control - 601, 616 (when used for Erosion Control), 659, 660, 670, 671, 690 (pertinent pay items), 832, 836, 838.

The Department will furnish Item 832, Each, Erosion Control/Construction Erosion Control with an amount in the proposal to pay for Temporary Sediment and Erosion Control (TSEC) Best Management Practices (BMP) work. This amount is an estimate by the Department of the total cost of TSEC BMP work. If the TSEC BMP work exceeds this amount, the TSEC BMP work will still be paid at the pre-determined prices. The pre-determined prices are located in Supplemental Specification 832.  A LS pay item for the Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) shall be included in the General Summary when a SWPPP is required.  Item 616, Water, must be added to all projects that require a 404/401 waterway permit. This quantity of water is used to comply with permit requirements regarding erosion and dust control near waterways. In addition, projects that include the Dust Control Plan note from the Traffic Engineering Manual should include this Item 616, Water, in the Maintenance of Traffic section of the General Summary.  Environmental / Remediation – 690 (pertinent pay items)  Drainage - 602, 605, 611 (when used for Drainage, except structures requiring a Structure File Number (SFN) and conduit for Pull Boxes), 613, 690 (pertinent pay items), 833, 837, 839, 841, 895, 899.  Pipe Alternates - In the following examples, the figure in parentheses at the end of the corrugated metal pipe descriptions indicates the metal thickness of the pipe; if there are two figures, the first figure indicates the thickness of the top plates and the second figure indicates the thickness of the bottom plates. If there is no figure, the thickness shown for that pipe size in the appropriate 707 Table of the Construction and Material Specifications will suffice and need not be shown on the plan. A figure in parentheses for 707.04 indicates the height of corrugation. A 1-inch corrugation should generally be noted for pipe diameters over 48 inches.

In order to effectively track bridge maintenance costs, quantities must be recorded separately for each bridge structure utilizing its assigned SFN. The following three options are acceptable:  Providing a separate general summary for each bridge by SFN within the bridge sheets with a reference from the General Summary to each Structure General Summary.    Providing a combined structure general summary that separates quantities for each bridge by SFN, also with a reference from the General Summary for each bridge.    Providing quantities for each bridge, broken out separately by SFN, on the General Summary.    Each Structure General Summary shall be combined with the General Summary in an Excel format using the standard spreadsheet, CTY-PID-GENSUM.xlsm.  See Section 1307.1 - General for more information.  Maintenance of Traffic - 410, 502, 614 (except Maintaining Traffic), 615, 616 (when used for Maintenance of Traffic), 622 (Portable Barrier), 690 (pertinent pay items), 808, 829, 831, 896, any additional items used specifically for maintenance of traffic.

Incidentals – 108, 614 (Maintaining Traffic), 619, 623 (Construction Layout Stakes and Surveying), 624, 690 (pertinent pay items).  The following incidental pay items shall be provided on the General Summary:  Incidentals –   614  LS, Maintaining Traffic  619  MNTH, Field Office, Type A, B or C  623  LS, Construction Layout Stakes and Surveying  624  LS/Each, Mobilization  Building Demolition is a type of project that would not require Item 614, Maintaining Traffic.   Two-lane resurfacing, mowing, pavement marking, guardrail replacement, bridge painting, and other similar types of projects may not require pay items for Field Office, Construction Layout Stakes and Surveying, or Mobilization.   The District Highway Management Administrator should be consulted when there is a question regarding the need for these incidental pay items.  The following guidelines are recommended when determining the type of Field Office to specify on a project:
Estimated Project
Construction Cost Office Type
Less than $500,000 Type A
$500,000 to $5,000,000 Type B Over $5,000,000 Type C
The basis of payment for a Field Office should be MNTH, unless otherwise instructed.
1307.2.4 Contingency Quantities
In some cases, it may not be feasible to obtain precise quantities due to uncertainties regarding existing conditions. In these cases, a reasonable estimate (not contingency) of the items necessary, along with the location to where they apply, should be completed and appropriate quantities shown in the plans. Contingency quantities should not be used.  Pavement cores, soil borings and other condition surveys commensurate with the nature of the proposed work should be used to assist with the determination of these quantities.
1307.2.5 Linear Grading
Linear grading pay items are intended for shallow grading and/or filling operations performed from the edge of pavement outward, to prepare, dress and/or reshape the roadside.
Item 209 - Reshaping Under Guardrail and Item 209 - Preparing Subgrade for Shoulder Paving are described in the Construction and Material Specifications. Item 209 - Linear Grading may be used at other locations with minor grading.  All three pay items are based on a linear measurement along each side of the pavement.
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
93
Sufficient detail must be included in the plans to estimate and construct the work.  When two or more different types of Item 209 - Linear Grading are required in the same plan, they should be differentiated by designating them as “Method A”, “Method B”, etc.  If off-project material is needed for the work, a quantity of Item 209 - Borrow must be specified in the plans.  Consideration should be given as to how this item is paid. If Item 209 - Borrow can be measured and calculated, then payment should be by the Cu. Yd. If the borrow cannot be measured due to settlement, or because the area is under water, then payment should be by the Ton.
1307.2.6 “Standard”, “As Per Plan”, “Miscellaneous”, and “Special” Pay Items
<em>There are four types of pay items in a construction plan, “Standard”, “As Per Plan”, “Miscellaneous”, and “Special”. A “Standard” pay item is one whose requirements are defined by the Standard Construction Drawings and the Construction and Material Specifications or Supplemental Specifications. The description of a “Standard” pay item is consistent from plan to plan and is listed under the heading “Basis of Payment” in the Construction and Material Specifications or Supplemental Specifications.  An “As Per Plan” item is a standard pay item whose requirements need to be modified from that which is defined by the Standard Construction Drawings, the Construction and Material Specifications, or Supplemental Specifications. Every “As Per Plan” item must have a corresponding plan note, Proposal Note, plan detail, or combination thereof which clearly and completely explains the deviation(s) from the standard item. The “As Per Plan” descriptor should not be included as part of a “Miscellaneous” or “Special” pay item description.  The location of “As Per Plan” notes and details shall be cross-referenced in the “See Sheet No.” column on the General Summary.  A “Miscellaneous” item code is used for unique or infrequently performed items. These items shall be within the guidelines of the Standard Construction Drawings, the Construction and Material Specifications, Supplemental Specifications, or any other authoritative document. Every “Miscellaneous” item must have a corresponding plan note, proposal note, plan detail, or combination thereof to completely explain the item. The location of “Miscellaneous” notes and details shall be cross-referenced in the “See Sheet No.” column on the General Summary sheet. If the item is “Miscellaneous”, the word “MISC.:” will be part of the item description.  A “Special” item is an item that does not exist in the Standard Construction Drawings, the Construction and Material Specifications or Supplemental Specifications. It must be created by means of plan notes, plan details, proposal notes, special provisions or a combination thereof, which clearly and completely define all aspects of the item. The location of “Special” item notes and details shall be cross-referenced in the “See Sheet No.” column on the General Summary.  “Special” pay items are coded according to the closest related Specification number. If the item is a “Special”, the word “Special” must be entered in the “Item” column and all eight digits of the item code are entered in the “Item Extension” column.</em>
1307.2.7 Alternate, Optional, and Additive Alternate Bid Items
Alternate, optional, and additive alternate bid items are included in a plan when so dictated by the sponsoring agency.  Alternate bid items shall be listed in the General Summary under a separate heading selected from the headings listed in Section 1307.2.3 – Item Code, Unit of Measure, and Description. This heading shall be modified by adding the word “ALTERNATES” (e.g., ROADWAY ALTERNATES, DRAINAGE ALTERNATES, etc.), and placed directly after its corresponding heading section. The description of individual alternate bid items shall include “ALTERNATE” followed by an appropriate numerical value, in parentheses, at the end. For each alternate bid item, an “X” shall be placed in the “ALT(X)” column in the General Summary [SP 1307-4].
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
94
The description for alternate bid items should vary to give distinction between items. One group of bid items can be alternated to another group of bid items without there being a one-to-one item match. Plan notes, plan details, proposal notes, special provisions, or a combination thereof shall be provided to clearly and completely define and identify the alternates. The bidder is required to bid on all alternate items. The sponsoring agency will determine the alternate item, or group of alternate items, selected for the contract to be awarded. When the higher priced alternate item is selected, the additional cost of the alternate will be the responsibility of the sponsoring agency.  Optional bid items shall be listed in the General Summary under a separate heading selected from the headings listed in Section 1307.2.3 – Item Code, Unit of Measure, and Description, with each set of optional bid items grouped together and designated with an alphabetical label (e.g., OPTION A, OPTION B, etc.) added to the heading. The heading shall be followed by a brief description and placed in alphabetical order directly after its corresponding heading section [SP 1307-3(c)].
When a group of bid items is optional to another group of bid items, each group of items will be given a single label. The bidder is to bid on one option only, with the bidder deciding which option to bid on.  Additive alternate bid items shall be listed in the General Summary under an “ADDITIVE ALTERNATE” heading followed by a numerical label (e.g. 1, 2, etc.). The heading shall be followed by a brief description and placed in numerical order directly before the incidental pay items [SP1307-3(d)].  Incidental pay items that incur additional costs due to the inclusion of the additive alternate shall be included in the bid items for the additive alternate.
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
95
Multiple sets of additive alternates are permissible. When multiple sets are used, the additive alternates are to be listed numerically in order of highest to lowest priority. The sponsoring agency will determine the order of priority. The bidder is required to bid on all additive alternate items.  Questions regarding the setup of alternate, optional, and additive alternate bid items on the General Summary should be addressed to the Office of Estimating.
1307.2.8 Sheet Cross References
The “See Sheet No.” column is used to show a cross-reference to a general note sheet, plan detail sheet or description group general summary.  References to a general note or plan detail for items that are not “As Per Plan” or “Special” should be made when the note or detail describes a specific method of performing work. Description groups that have their general summaries cross-referenced should be listed in the order shown in Section 1307.2.3 – Item Code, Unit of Measure, and Description.    Reference to a Proposal Note may be made at the end of a pay item description only if the pay item is new, or rarely used.
1307.2.9 Buildings Demolished
Buildings to be demolished should be paid for under Item 202, Building Demolished. A single lump sum item is used for each parcel. The item description should include the parcel number and a list of the buildings to be removed.  For example:  Item 202, Building Demolished, Parcel 10 WD, 2-Story Framed House, Basement, Shed  Item 202, Building Demolished, Parcel 20 T, 1-Story Brick House, 2-Car Detached Garage  Item 202, Building Demolished, Parcel 102 WL, Remove 20 Trailers, 6 Sheds  For additional information contact the Office of Real Estate.
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
96
1307.2.10 Salvage to Utility Items
Existing utility facilities (fire hydrants, valve boxes, etc.) to be removed by the highway contractor shall be disposed of and replaced, adjusted, or removed and reset. These items shall not be removed and stored for retrieval by the utility owner. The rules governing utility relocation and reimbursement differ from other functions of the highway construction process. The removal of existing facilities for storage would require that a salvage credit be given to the project for the value of the removed items, and any contractor charges for handling and/or transportation of the items would be ineligible for project cost.
1307.3 Subsummaries
A limited number of sheet number columns are available on the General Summary. This limits the number of sheets from which quantities can be brought forward. It is therefore necessary on larger plans to summarize quantities in stages. Subsummaries are plan sheets where quantities from several sheets are gathered. The items may or may not have some relationship to each other.    Some of the pavement marking quantities are subdivided and subtotaled by color and/or type.  Examples of subsummary sheets are included in the Sample Plan Sheets.  Subsummaries are generally located in a set of plans near (normally in front of) the source of the quantities they summarize. However, when they summarize a number of unrelated items, they may be located either after the General Summary or after the calculation sheets.
1307.4 Quantity Calculations
1307.4.1 General
In order to prepare a valid engineering cost estimate for a project, it is essential that quantities be accurately calculated, accurately carried to the General Summary, and that substantiating data for all calculated items be included in the plan.
1307.4.2 Pavement Calculations
Pavement, subgrade compaction and treated shoulder quantity computations should be completed on 8 1/2” x 11” sheets. Computations are to clearly show how the quantities were derived. Irregular areas should be noted as CADD generated areas. All sheets must include the project title and be numbered (e.g., 2 of 10). Quantities are to be carried to the General Summary and listed under a column entitled “Office Calcs.” [SP 1307-3(a) and 1307-3(b)].
1307.4.3 Rounding of Quantities
Rounding of quantities should be made at the subsummary level. All quantities are whole numbers except as follows:</li>
<li>Carried to tenths:  Cubic Yards - Masonry   Square Feet - Signs
Feet - Ground Mounted Sign Supports</li>
<li>Carried to the nearest foot
Feet - Conduit and Underdrains, Subdrainage piping (Structural)</li>
<li>Carried to hundredths:
Miles - Pavement Marking  Feet - Bridge Deck Joints, Drip Strip, Prestressed Concrete Bridge Members
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
97
Tons - Commercial Fertilizer  Acres - Lime</li>
<li>Nearest 100 Pounds
Pounds - Structural Steel  Guardrail quantities are normally determined in standard 12.5&#39; panel lengths.
1307.4.4 Validation of Quantities
Prior to submission of the completed plans, all plan quantities shall be independently checked by competent personnel other than the person(s) who originally computed the quantities. Each plan sheet that lists quantities or calculations shall be validated by the signed initials or names of persons who computed the quantities, and also those who performed the checking operations.  These initials should be shown in the title block. While it is contemplated that spot checks of quantities will be made during review of the plan, the correctness of the quantities is the responsibility of the design unit preparing the plans.
1308 Project Site Plan
1308.1 General
A Project Site Plan is required for all projects that require the submittal of a Notice of Intent (NOI) or post construction BMPs, as explained in the Location and Design Manual, Volume 2, Section 1109.  The Project Site Plan is prepared by the designer and provided as part of the contract documents.  Electronic design files used to create the Project Site Plan are also a part of the contract documents and shall be provided.  For more information, see Section 1600, Electronic Design Deliverables.  A sample Project Site Plan is shown in the Sample Plan Sheets [SP 1308-1].  For non-contiguous portions of projects sold under one contract, as described in Location and Design Manual, Volume 2, Section 1109, provide a Project Site Plan for each individual site that exceeds one acre of earth disturbing activity.  A Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) is required for all projects that submit a Notice of Intent (NOI) for permit coverage under the Ohio EPA’s Construction General Permit. Projects that may have environmental impacts to habitat, or species, may also be required to prepare a SWPPP as determined by the District Environmental Coordinator. The construction contractor is responsible for modifying the Project Site Plan to prepare a SWPPP that meets the Ohio EPA NPDES (National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System) Permit requirements. The contractor shall develop the SWPPP in accordance with Supplemental Specification 832. The contractor’s engineer must sign, seal, and submit the proposed plan to ODOT for review. Additional guidance can be found in the Location and Design Manual, Volume 2, Section 1110.
1308.2 Requirements
The Project Site Plan shall consist of a schematic plan similar to that required in Section 1303 – Schematic Plan. It will generally have a scale of 1&#34;=200&#39;. This plan shall show all Project Disturbed Areas.  The following items shall be included on the plan and may be listed in tabular form:</li>
<li>A site description indicating the nature and type of construction activity.</li>
<li>The total area of project (right-of-way, including permanent easements).

The location of permanent storm water Best Management Practices (BMP) through a description, graphically, and in tabular form. Ensure all latitude and longitude positions are in units of decimal degrees and have 6 values after the decimal. Furnish a begin position and end position for the following linear BMPs: Vegetated Filter Strip and Vegetated Biofilter. Furnish just the outlet position of all other BMPs. Include a table that lists each individual BMP, the BMP type, the Begin Latitude/Longitude, the End Latitude/Longitude (if applicable), the BMP Width (strip width for Vegetated Filter Strips and bottom width for Vegetated Biofilters only), and the EDA Treatment Credit. In the same table, provide the summation of EDA Treatment Credit from all BMPs, as well as the EDA Treatment Credit Required for the project.
1309 Plan and Profile Sheets
1309.1 General
Plan &amp; Profile Sheets [SP 1309-1(a) through SP 1309-8] show what an area looks like before (existing) and after (proposed) construction of the project. In addition, they show quantities, dimensions, and other items required to construct the project. Plan and Profile Sheets are normally drawn to the following scales:  Rural Projects:

<li>Horizontal: 1&#34;=50&#39;, or 1&#34;=20&#39;   - Vertical: 1&#34;= 5&#39;, or 1&#34;=10&#39;  Urban (or Short Rural) Projects:   - Horizontal: 1&#34;=20&#39;  - Vertical: 1”=5&#39; (preferred) or 1”=10&#39;  The above scales will result in coverage on a typical sheet of 1500&#39; at 1&#34;=50&#39; and 600&#39; at 1&#34;=20&#39;. For convenience, the scale used for the roadway plan and profile sheets should match the scale used on the right-of-way detail sheets.  The profile should be plotted on a square grid system subdivided in accordance with the examples shown in Figure 1202-1, Acceptable Grid Systems.  The plan and profile sheets at the beginning and end of the project should include additional length of existing topographic features beyond the ends of the permanent pavement construction. The minimum additional length is 300 feet for design speeds of 40 mph or less and 500 feet for design speeds over 40 mph. Horizontal and vertical alignments and all topography should be shown in these “extension” areas.  To avoid misinterpretations, the use of abbreviations in the plans, except those defined in the Construction and Materials Specifications or generally understood by engineers and contractors, should be minimized. If abbreviations are used, a legend explaining the abbreviations should be included.
1309.2 Format
Plan &amp; Profile Sheets are composed of three distinct parts - plan, profile and quantities. All of these parts may be shown on a single sheet [SP 1309-5, 1309-6, and 1309-8]. However, because of the complexity of some plans, it may be necessary to vary the format to more clearly show the proposed work.  In such cases, the plan, profile and quantities may be shown on separate sheets [SP 1309-2] or combined in any manner [SP 1309-1(a) and 1309-1(b)].  When varying from the single-sheet format, the designer should locate the plan, profile and quantity sheets as near to each other as possible and provide cross-references on each sheet.
1309.3 Existing Information
All existing features should be shown and the disposition of all such items within the existing and/or proposed right-of-way should be indicated.  Existing features, except buildings, should be shown using dashed lines. The following sections list many of the existing items that should be shown on a Plan &amp; Profile Sheet. This list should not be considered all-inclusive.
1309.3.1 Topography</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Trees and stumps – For projects involving earth disturbing activities or any other construction activity that may require tree removal, the diameter of all trees and stumps 12 inches and over must be shown.  Symbols should be used to differentiate between deciduous and coniferous trees.  Species names (e.g., Oak, Maple, Pine) do not need to be labeled.  In general, labels designating tree size (as defined in the Construction and Material Specifications) should be provided for trees located within the construction limits and 25 feet outside the project construction limits.  Trees and stumps to be removed should be noted by an “X”.</li>
<li>Shrubs</li>
<li>Moving water such as creeks, streams, rivers and ditches - The direction of flow should be denoted by flow
arrows.

1309.4 Proposed Facility Information
Following are many of the proposed facility items that should be shown on a Plan &amp; Profile sheet. This list should not be considered all-inclusive.
1309.4.1 Alignment and Grade
Centerline of construction and any other construction baselines should be shown along with their relationship to each other.  Stations, station equations, and bearings (at each tangent and at least one per sheet) must be shown.  The centerline of construction should match the centerline of right-of-way. In those instances where it is not possible to match the two centerlines, a constant offset between the two centerlines is preferred. When the two centerlines differ, their relationship must be shown in the right-of-way plans. It is not necessary to show this relationship within the construction plans.  Stationing shall be designated in feet per the following examples: 104+59.35, meaning 10,459.35 feet from Sta. 0+00.  When giving locations of points intermediate of full stations and leaving off the full station designation, all leading zeros should be included. For example: +03.17 would be the abbreviated form of Sta. 2+03.17.  When a centerline includes a deflection angle (i.e., a P.I. without a horizontal curve), there can be confusion on how to measure stations and offsets from the back and forward tangents. The following figure clarifies which tangent to use depending on a point’s location in the “overlap” area.
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
102
In addition to the “overlap” area, there is a “blind” area in which a station and offset cannot be measured from either the back or forward tangent. Stations and offsets in the “blind” area should be measured off an extended back tangent as shown in the figure.  Indicate when station and offset are being reported along the extended back tangent in the “blind” area as follows:
Sta. 12+75.00, 30.00’ Rt., on Extended Back Tangent</li>
<li>Grades are to be shown using percentages to the hundredths.</li>
<li>Profile grade elevations are to be shown every 25&#39;. The location of the profile grade elevation is shown on the Typical Sections.</li>
<li>Elevations shall be expressed in feet above the specified datum.</li>
<li>Horizontal alignment data – Show all data for simple curves and spiral curves (See Figure_1303-1, 1303-2 and 1303-3). All proposed horizontal alignment data (e.g. curve information, station equations, reference points, etc.) shall be specified to the nearest hundredth of a foot.</li>
<li>Vertical alignment data – The data includes the station and elevation of the PVI and the limits and length of vertical curve.  When there is a grade break without a vertical curve, the words “NO CURVE” should be added adjacent to the PVI station and elevation [SP 1309-1(a)].</li>
<li>Vertical clearance under overhead structures - The existing, proposed and required clearance shall be shown.</li>
<li>Vertical clearance under major overhead electric transmission lines.

<li>Guardrail – Label anchor assemblies, bridge terminal assemblies, terminal stations, flare and radii [SP 1309-
2 and 1309-8].</li>
<li>Concrete barrier – Label terminal stations, end anchorages, transitions, and end treatments like impact

control signs (i.e. mounted on yielding posts) are normally shown on a separate traffic control plan sheet.</li>
<li>Bridge limits, structure number, approach slab limits, and pier locations [SP 1309-8].
1309.4.3 Boundary Lines</li>
<li>Right-of-Way, easement, temporary right-of-way and limited access lines</li>
<li>Construction limits – These limits must encompass all work. This includes removals, room for construction
equipment to complete work, site access, etc. Construction limits are not intended to encompass storage areas for materials or equipment. However, it may be necessary to address storage areas when determining a project’s environmental impacts.</li>
<li>Property Lines – Show property lines when right-of-way is being acquired or when the project includes access
management changes for properties along the roadway.
1309.4.4 Drainage Items

Label the proposed conduit with reference balloons, size and type (e.g. 36” – Type C) in the plan view and profile view. Proposed detailed drainage structure and conduit information should be shown per Section 1312.3 – Storm Sewer Profiles. Label existing drainage structure and conduit information in the plan view and profile view pertinent for design analysis, review, and constructability.</li>
<li>Manholes and Catch Basins reconstructed or adjusted to grade – Label on the plan view and profile view pertinent information for design analysis, review, and constructability, this includes proposed and existing elevations.
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025

1309.5 Quantities
Plan &amp; Profile sheets are used to show many of the plan quantities as described in the following sections.
1309.5.1 Reference Balloons
Reference balloons are used to tie the items on the plan to the pay quantities in the estimated quantities table. The designations within the balloon correspond with the reference designation in the estimated quantities table. Dashed balloons are used to indicate that quantities are picked up on a different sheet.  Reference balloon numbering may be restarted on each plan sheet or may be carried through the entire plan. A consistent system of reference balloon numbering should be used for each project. [SP1309-1(a)] and [SP 1309-1(b)] provide an example of sequential balloon numbering that is carried through all plan and profile sheets. [SP 1309-6] provides an example of balloon numbering that is restarted for each plan and profile sheet.  For drainage  reference balloons use unique balloon numbering for each drainage structure and conduit run. Do not reuse balloon references within the same plan set. Provide reference balloon on each sheet for each run of conduit.
1309.5.2 Estimated Quantities
Quantities should be shown in tabular form in such a manner as to clearly show the following:</li>
<li>Reference Designation - This is usually a combination of letters and numbers. The letters indicate the general
description of the item (Example - UD or U for underdrain, GR or G for guardrail, D for drainage structures, P for conduit, S for sanitary sewer, C for curb, DR for driveways, R for removal, WQ for manufactured water quality structure), and numbers differentiate between similar items (D-1, D-2 and D-3 might be used when there were three drainage items on one Plan &amp; Profile Sheet).</li>
<li>Location - This includes the limiting stations and side (Rt. or Lt.)</li>
<li>Item Number or Special and item description</li>
<li>Unit of Measure (ft2, yd3, mi., etc.)</li>
<li>Item quantity and total quantity
Indicate whether the total quantities are carried to the General Summary or to a Subsummary Sheet.
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
105
1309.6 Miscellaneous Information
In addition to existing and proposed information and quantities, Plan &amp; Profile sheets include other information pertinent to the project, such as the following:
1309.6.1 Project Control and Reference Points
Points used to establish project control along with the associated reference points are more commonly shown on the Schematic Plan or General Notes. When a Schematic Plan is not provided or for other unique situations where the project control points and reference points cannot be shown in the Schematic Plan or General Notes, these points should be shown on the Plan sheets as described in Section 1303.2.2.
1309.6.2 Cross References to Other Sheets
Where quantities, details, etc. are shown on other sheets, cross-references are required.
1309.6.3 Typical Sections of Adjoining Pavement
When not shown with the Typical Section Sheets, the first and last Plan &amp; Profile Sheet should show a detail of the Typical Section of the Adjoining Pavement, including type, thickness and cross slopes of all pavement courses.
1309.6.4 Project and Work Limits
If the Project and Work Limits are not provided in the Schematic Plan, the limits should be shown on the appropriate Plan &amp; Profile Sheets.
1309.6.5 Match Lines
A match line should be shown, and the station given, wherever the plan view, work or quantities are continued on another sheet. It is recommended that the match lines be made at a location where the stationing is a multiple of 100 feet.
1310 Cross-Sections
1310.1 General
Although the main purpose for cross-sections is to show end areas and surface dimensions for the calculation of earthwork and seeding quantities, they conveniently show a wealth of additional information, which will be discussed in part in the following sections [SP 1310-1 through SP 1310-4].    In complicated areas such as interchanges, a cross-section layout sheet may be required. A cross-section layout sheet is a plan sheet showing where each section is located [SP 1310-6].
1310.2 Format
Cross-Sections are plotted on a 1&#34; x 1&#34; grid system subdivided in accordance with the examples shown in Figure 1202-1. Horizontal and vertical scales are equal - usually 1&#34;=5&#39; or 1&#34;=10&#39;. Elevations are labeled along each side at the major grid lines. When a 1&#34;=10&#39; scale is used, the even elevations are located at the 1&#34; grid lines. The distance, measured from the centerline of construction, is labeled at the top and bottom of the sheet at the vertical major grid lines.    Intervals between regular sections should normally be 50&#39;. Intervals of 25&#39; should be used where greater detail is required. In addition, sections (or partial sections) are plotted at abrupt ground line changes or to show special
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
106
features such as drives, bridges, or drainage items. Sections must be shown as often as necessary to accurately determine the character and extent of the proposed work. When existing and proposed features are located between two cross-sections, it is preferred that either additional cross-sections be included at the location of the feature, or they be shown on a storm sewer profile sheet.  Cross section sheets shall be laid out such that stationing increases from the bottom to the top of the sheet. The station is shown in bold print under each section at the centerline of construction. The existing ground elevation at the centerline of construction is shown directly below the station number and the elevation of the proposed grade at the profile grade point is shown directly above the station number. A project may require two profile grade points to be shown on the cross-sections.    Exaggerated cross-sections may be included in the plan, or provided on separate sheets, with the Stage 3 submission for review and reference during construction of the project. They are used to calculate variable depth pavement leveling course quantities or to show variable depth pavement planning.  Existing features are shown with dashed lines and proposed features are shown with solid lines. Surface, base and subbase courses of proposed pavement are not shown. Likewise, interpretations of the subsurface investigation, such as top of rock, are not shown. The limits of the existing pavement should be shown.    The ratio for each side-slope and back-slope (2:1, 3:1, etc.) should be labeled at the top and bottom sections on each sheet and at any intermediate sections where there is a change in the slope.
1310.3 Earthwork and Seeding Quantities
1310.3.1 Earthwork Calculations
End areas (calculated to the nearest square foot and earthwork volumes (cubic yards are shown for cuts and fills in the columns on the right side of the cross-section sheet. Separate calculations must be shown when different types of earthwork (e.g., Item 203 and Item 204) are included [SP 1310-2 and 1310-4].    Concrete pavement removal must be itemized separately and paid for under Item 202, Pavement Removed.  On large projects, asphalt concrete pavement removal should be itemized separately under Item 202, Pavement Removed, Asphalt [SP 1310-7]. Adjustments must be made for drives, intersections, etc. When pavement is removed and is to be replaced with embankment material, the quantity of embankment must be included in the plans using the applicable 203 or 204 pay item.  End areas may be determined using computer programs, planimetering, or summation of geometric shapes. Subtotals for earthwork quantities should be shown on each sheet and carried to a subsummary in advance of the cross-sections or directly to the General Summary.
1310.3.2 Earthwork Corrections for Curvature
When computing earthwork for a project, it is important that the designer consider the effect of curvature on the volumes of cut and fill, and adjust the quantities where warranted. Curvature may have a significant effect where there are side-hill cuts and/or fills where the centroid of either area is significantly displaced from the centerline. The magnitude is a function of the curve radius, with shorter radii curves (such as may be used on ramps) having the greater effect. Whenever the true volume of cut or fill, or both combined, based on the centroidal arc length, differs by one cubic yard per yard of distance between adjacent cross-sections from the estimated volumes based on the survey length, a correction shall be shown in the plans.  It is assumed that the actual true volume of a curved prismoid is the product of the average area of end sections times the arch length passing midway between the centroids (centers-of-gravity) of the end sections.  If the centroidal arc lies on the inside of a curve, its length is shorter than the centerline distance; if it lies on the outside, its length is longer.
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
107
To adjust earthwork volumes for curvature, the corrected-arc-length method should be used. This method is simple and easy to understand and is easily adapted to computer programs for earthwork.  An example of this method is shown in the following figure:
The diagram of the example showing the method of correction should be shown on the General Note Sheet. The corrected arc lengths should be shown in the earthwork tabulations on the cross-section sheets.
1310.3.3 Roads for Maintaining Traffic
Roads for Maintaining Traffic, along with their baseline (if any) should be shown on the cross-sections [SP 1310-2 and SP 1310-3].  Earthwork for Roads for Maintaining Traffic shall be shown by heavy dashed lines.  This includes both the portion to be removed under Item 615, Roads for Maintaining Traffic, as well as the overlapping areas of earthwork that will remain as part of the permanent facility.   Earthwork cut and fill end areas for Roads for Maintaining Traffic may be shown on the cross-sections with quantities located in separate cut and fill columns or marked with an asterisk. Alternatively, they may be calculated and included for estimating purposes on the Office of Estimating’s Estimated Quantities form which can be found in Appendix D. The totals of the earthwork cut and fill for Roads for Maintaining Traffic shall be provided in the General Notes.
1310.3.4 Seeding Calculations
Except on projects where the seeding quantities can otherwise be determined with reasonable accuracy, seeding end widths and areas should be shown on the cross-sections. The limits of seeding shall be all areas of exposed soil between the right-of-way lines and within the construction limits for areas outside the right-of-way lines.  End widths measured to the closest foot and seeding areas (sq. yards) are shown in the columns on the left side of the Cross-Section sheet. Adjustments must be made for drives, intersections, etc. [SP 1310-3] Subtotals for seeding quantities should be shown on each sheet and carried to a subsummary in advance of the Cross-Sections or directly to the General Summary.
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
108
1310.4 Drainage Items
Existing and proposed drainage facilities should be shown on the Cross-Sections. This includes, but is not limited to ditches, permanent erosion control items, storm sewers, culverts, headwalls, catch basins, inlets, manholes, drive pipes, and other longitudinal drainage items.   Ditch flowline elevations and flow arrows should be shown.  Existing facilities to be removed or abandoned should be so noted.   Existing normal water level elevations should also be noted for lakes, ponds, rivers and streams. The elevation of the Ordinary High Water Mark (OHWM) should be identified for any waterway feature (e.g., streams, jurisdictional ditches, lakes, reservoirs, and ponds) being addressed through the Waterway Permit.    Drainage items are normally shown on the Plan &amp; Profile Sheets and the Drainage Detail sheets, in addition to the Cross-Sections. Label the proposed drainage structures with reference balloons. Label the proposed conduit with reference balloons, size, and type (e.g., 36” – Type C). Detailed information for proposed drainage structure and conduit information should be shown per Section 1312.3 – Storm Sewer Profiles. Label existing drainage structure and conduit information pertinent for design analysis, review, and constructability.
1310.5 Drives
Drive profiles should be shown on the cross-sections. Profiles which do not fall at a full cross-section should be shown on a partial section. The drive’s station, length and grade should be labeled.  Separate drive profile sheets are not typically required, although they may be needed for long drives [SP 1310-5].
1310.6 Miscellaneous Items
Some of the other items that should be shown on the Cross-Sections include retaining walls, limits of subgrade stabilization and all underground utilities.
1311 Miscellaneous Details  Miscellaneous Details is a section of the plan that serves as a “catch-all” for items that do not fit under other headings. Some of the items that may fall into this category are included in the following subsections.
1311.1 Drive Details
Drive details [SP 1311-4 and 1311-5] show the geometry and build-up of drives. Typically, this information can be adequately presented in tabular format and separate drive details are not needed.
1311.2 Grading Details
Grading Details [SP 1311-12] are sheets showing the graded shoulder, slope breaks, drainage structures, ditches, and flow arrows. A grading detail should be provided for intersections and interchanges on complicated plans where cross-sections and profiles cannot adequately describe the grading.

1312.3 Storm Sewer Profiles
Show storm sewer profiles on a separate sheet which includes a schematic plan view of the storm sewer system and table detailing drainage structure and conduit information. See Sample Plans [SP 1312-4a and 1312-4b].   Label the proposed drainage structures with reference balloons in plan view and profile view. Label the proposed conduit with reference balloons, size, and type (e.g., 36” – Type C) in the plan view and profile view. Label flow arrows showing direction of flow for conduits in the plan view. Label existing drainage structure and conduit information pertinent for design analysis, review, and constructability.   The detailed drainage structure table should include reference number, reference alignment name, station, offset, side, type, grate/rim elevation, invert elevation, connected pipe information (direction of flow, conduit balloon reference number, cardinal direction, size, and invert elevation,), and existing structure disposition.  The detailed conduit table should include reference number, Conduit File Number, length, size, type, slope, start/stop structure reference numbers, start/stop invert elevations, and existing conduit disposition.   Include a Conduit File Number (CFN) for Type B conduits with a span as measured along the centerline of the roadway, of 12 inches or greater but less than 120 inches. Conduits with a span equal to or greater than 120 inches require a Structural File Number (SFN).
1312.4 Precast Drainage Structures
In addition to the culvert details specified in Section 1312.2 – Culvert Details, precast drainage structures (i.e. C&amp;MS 706.05, 706.051, 706.052 &amp; 706.053) require the Designers to prepare plans using one of the methods listed below. For more information about choosing a Plan Preparation method refer to BDM Section 311.2.2.
A. Cast-in-place full-height headwalls as illustrated in Sample Plan Sheets [SP 1312-6(a) through 6(h)] with the following minimum Plan Details:</li>

1312.5 Underdrain Details
Underdrains are typically shown in detail in the plan view of the Plan &amp; Profile sheets. However, in cases where the Plan &amp; Profile sheets are too congested, it is recommended to show underdrains on a separate sheet. Underdrain details show the size of underdrain, type of underdrain, tees, bends, crosses, and outlets for underdrains.
1313 Sanitary Sewer and Water Work Plans  Normally, sanitary sewer and water work can adequately be shown on the regular Plan &amp; Profile sheets. Occasionally, however, where the project is complex, or the magnitude of this type of work is extensive, special plan sheets may be required [SP 1313-1 and SP 1313-2].

<p>1401 Design Review Process
1401.1 Introduction
ODOT’s Project Development Process is a project management and decision-making process, which provides a team-oriented approach to developing a transportation project. It is the framework for project development and guides it from conception through completion. The PDP also establishes the scope of work for a project and its deliverables. Refer to the PDP Manual and PDP website for more information.  This section of the Location and Design Manual provides a general overview of plan development. It does not detail design standards, nor provide guidance on how to evaluate any particular design component or environmental issue. Design and environmental requirements are provided in various technical manuals and policies.
1402 Project Phases
(See also Figure 1402-1)
The Project Development Process (PDP) is a project management and transportation decision-making tool that outlines project development from concept through completion. It encourages communication among disciplines, eliminates duplication of effort, minimizes cost overruns, and provides for early identification of potential issues. For example, by identifying environmentally sensitive resources early in the PDP process opportunities to minimize direct impacts are afforded, thereby resulting in the production of quality plans.  The PDP consists of five phases that projects must advance through. These phases are Planning (PL), Preliminary Engineering (PE), Environmental Engineering (EE), Final Engineering/ROW Phase (FE), and Construction (CO). Depending on the project’s size, complexity, and/or potential impact to the environment, the amount of time spent in each phase will vary.  A brief overview of project phases is detailed in the following sections.
1402.1 Planning Phase (PL)
Planning is the first phase of the PDP and provides a starting point for decision-making. It creates the foundation upon which the later PDP phases depend and assumes that a transportation improvement is warranted to address a problem identified through a prioritization process. But it does not assume the specific project-level needs to be addressed, facility type or project to be constructed.
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
124
1402.2 Preliminary Engineering (PE)
Preliminary Engineering begins the process of collecting more detailed information in order to develop and compare alternatives. This is done by conducting field investigations, performing technical studies, and developing preliminary engineering level of plans. This work builds upon, and refines, the information and analysis produced during the Planning Phase (PL). A primary product of Preliminary Engineering is the recommendation of the preferred alternative for the project. PE initiates the Stage 1 detailed design.
1402.3 Environmental Engineering (EE)
In the Environmental Engineering (EE) phase, detailed environmental analysis of the preferred alternative is performed concurrently with detailed engineering, and other technical studies.  The EE builds upon and refines the information and analyses produced during the Preliminary Engineering Phase (PE). The intent of the process is to have refined environmental studies and design work initiated concurrently on the preferred alternative, along with solid decision-making.
1402.4 Final Engineering/ROW Phase (FE)
During the Final Engineering/ROW Phase, projects are advanced to full development.    The acquisition of any necessary right-of-way is finalized in this phase.  Stage 3 detailed design is also completed during this phase. Plans must contain all details and quantities required to bid and construct the proposed project, including a final cost estimate. A Stage 3 Detailed Design Review Submission must also be reviewed and approved by the District. It Is recommended that a second Stage 3 Detailed Design Review be conducted if more than two years have elapsed since the first Stage 3 Detailed Design Review, and the Final Tracing Package has not been submitted to Central Office.  The Project Manager is responsible for ensuring:</p>
<ul>
<li>project has been fully developed,</li>
<li>all necessary legislation has been completed,</li>
<li>PS&amp;E package has been finalized,</li>
<li>performance of any other technical and engineering tasks,</li>
<li>Plan Package meets all construction schedule deadlines.
Before the project can proceed to the next phase, the Final Plan Package is prepared and submitted to the ODOT Office of Estimating.
1402.5 Construction (CO)
The Construction Phase can be defined as the execution and administration of the contract documents and is the final step in the Project Development Process (PDP). It begins when the Final Plan Package has been submitted to Central Office. After the contract is awarded, ODOT monitors, manages, and documents the contractor’s activities to ensure compliance with the plans, proposal, and specifications.  The Contractor is responsible for constructing the work as detailed in the contract documents. The Project Engineer is responsible for ensuring that the terms of the construction contract are fulfilled. The Contract is a written agreement between the Department and the Contractor, setting forth the obligations of the parties, including, but not limited to the performance of the work and the basis of payment. Requirements for the management of the contract after the award can be found in the Construction Administration Manual of Procedures and the ODOT Construction and Materials Specifications (CMS).
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
125
1403 Project Classification  ODOT projects fall into one of five path categories (Paths 1-5). Selection of the appropriate project path is based on the project’s size, anticipated level of project complexity and/or potential impact to the environment. The project’s path identifies the recommended level of analysis, amount of stakeholder involvement, and activities performed during each phase. For classification purposes, the relative complexity of a project should be evaluated on a statewide, rather than a district-wide basis.  When trying to determine which path a project should follow, it may be difficult to determine if it fits better in one category versus another. When this situation arises, it is recommended that the higher category be selected.  More information on Project Path categories can be found in the following sections, and in the PDP Manual.
1403.1 Path 1 Projects
Path 1 projects are defined as “simple” transportation improvements generated by traditional and preventative maintenance. They may involve structure work and roadway resurfacing but do not include ROW or utility impacts. From an environmental perspective, they are typically processed as low-level Categorical Exclusion (CE) NEPA documents.
1403.2 Path 2 Projects
Path 2 projects are simple transportation projects which include non-complex structure, or roadway work.  These projects typically include minor ROW acquisition (e.g., strip takes, temporary easements). Path 2 projects are typically low-level Categorical Exclusion (CE) NEPA documents and will likely have one viable alternative.
1403.3 Path 3 Projects
Path 3 projects involve a higher level of difficulty than projects in Paths 1 or 2. These projects are generally located on an existing alignment, although to improve geometric conditions small adjustments to the existing alignment and which do not result in significant environmental impacts may be involved. They involve moderate roadway and/or structure work and may include capacity additions. They can also involve utility relocations and ROW acquisitions, including relocations. Due to the wide range of potential impacts, and the amount of H required, Path 3 projects can fall under a wide range of environmental document levels, from C2 through D3.
1403.4 Path 4 Projects
Path 4 projects include roadway and structure work that add capacity and involve consideration of complex and competing interests. Path 4 projects may have multiple alignment alternatives and can include extended highway widening (typically not within the median) in suburban settings, new alignments in rural settings, or implementing corridor-wide access management. These projects have substantial utility and/or ROW relocations/impacts. They typically require a higher-level Categorical Exclusion, Environmental Assessment, or Environmental Impact Statement NEPA document.
1403.5 Path 5 Projects
Mostly urban transportation improvements, Path 5 projects involve the highest complexity of design work; have a higher probability of public controversy, multiple alternatives, and complex utility and access management issues.  In addition to requiring a substantial financial investment, Path 5 projects can be expected to have a significant impact on the highway’s level of service, traffic flow, mobility patterns, mode shares and right-of-way.
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
126
From an environmental standpoint, Path 5 projects include any project type in an urban setting that might impact a high-quality environmental resource or require agency coordination at several decision points in the PDP. They’re typically higher level NEPA documents and require an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) or an Environmental Assessment (EA) NEPA document, but in some instances could be processed as a high-level Categorical Exclusion (CE) NEPA document.
1404 Review Process Determination  The District shall ensure every ODOT project is reviewed for compliance with the Scope of Services.  There are several review categories in which a project may fall:</li>
<li>Staged Review</li>
<li>Limited Review</li>
<li>Design-Build</li>
<li>Local-Let Development Process
The review process which may be applied to a project is based upon its path and is determined by the District office. Irrespective of the number, or the detail of review submittals required, the Designer of Record is responsible for plan accuracy and adherence to all design and plan preparation requirements.  A description of each review process can be found in the sections which follow.
1404.1 Staged Review Process
The Staged Review Process consists of a series of review submissions at various stages of the design process. As the number of project alternatives is reduced, the level of design detail increases.  The Staged Review Process may be customized by combining review submissions and/or modifying the content of individual review submissions. Customizations of the Staged Review Process must be listed in the project’s Scope of Services document.  The Districts shall ensure that plans processed through the Staged Review Process are reviewed for compliance with the Scope of Services and to ensure compliance with current specifications, standards, policies and procedures.
1404.2 Limited Review Process
The Limited Review Process may be applied to Path 1, Path 2, and Path 3 projects which have a well-defined scope, limited environmental impact and utility involvement. Except for the Feasibility Study, bridge projects, and Final Right-of-way plans, ODOT will not review the plans for accuracy and adherence to design and plan preparation requirements. However, projects must still be in compliance with the Scope of Services.  Although design activities associated with Stage 1 Detailed Design, Stage 2 Detailed Design, Stage 3 Detailed Design, and Preliminary Right-of-way must be performed, their review submittals may be omitted. If no temporary or permanent right-of-way is to be acquired, the Compliance Right-of-way review submission may also be omitted.  External agency approvals (e.g. FAA Notification/Clearance, Waterway Permits, LD-33 County Engineer Approval, Railroad Agreements), and Central Office approvals (e.g. Design Exceptions, Maintenance of Traffic Exceptions Committee, and Waterway Permit determination) must be obtained.
The Design Agency shall receive acceptance from the District for any minor design decisions that occur after the Feasibility Study. The Design Agency must notify the District with the description of each alternative and an
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
127
assessment of the impacts of each alternative on project cost, traffic operation, right-of-way cost, utility relocations, environmental impacts and any other associated impacts.  Below are typical design review submittals required by the Limited Review Process:</li>
<li>Project Initiation Package</li>
<li>Feasibility Study</li>
<li>Compliance Right-of-way
It is important to note that the Limited Review Process cannot be applied to projects requiring Federal oversight. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is responsible for ensuring that all federal-aid highway programs are delivered consistent with established requirements.
1404.3 Design-Build Process
Design-Build projects combine the detailed design and construction of a project into a single contract.  The Design Agency and construction contractor form a team. They work concurrently on the design and construction phases of a project, which expedites project delivery.  For Path 1 projects, the Design-Build team will submit Stage 3 Detailed Design plans (without quantities) for review and acceptance. Other reviews are not normally required.  For higher path projects, the Design-Build team will submit Stage 1 and Stage 2 Detailed Design for review and acceptance. The Design-Build team may design and submit Stage 1 and Stage 2 information in phases consisting of buildable units (e.g., earthwork, pavement replacement, etc.) for review. The scope and design shall be coordinated with the District and authorization must be granted prior to submitting various plan components for review.  All external agency approvals (e.g., FAA Notification/Clearance, Waterway Permits, LD-33 County Engineer Approval, Railroad Agreements) and Central Office approvals (e.g., Waterway Permit Determinations, Design Exceptions, Maintenance of Traffic Exceptions Committee) must be obtained.  Additional information on the Design-Build process can be found at the following link:
<a href="https://www.transportation.ohio.gov/working/construction/alternative-project-delivery">https://www.transportation.ohio.gov/working/construction/alternative-project-delivery</a>
1404.4 Local-Let Local Public Agency (LPA) Project Review Process
LPA projects are transportation improvement or enhancement projects that are funded primarily with federal or state monies, and if required, matched with local resources. Traditional LPA projects are those administered by ODOT, whereas Local-let LPA projects are those in which the LPA assumes project administration duties.  To the extent practical and feasible, ODOT will minimize its direct involvement in the design and delivery of projects that are funded with local and federal monies, or local and state monies, which do not directly involve routes on the National Highway System. Local public agencies may voluntarily assume the responsibility for project management tasks as determined and in coordination with the ODOT District Office.    For these local-let LPA projects, review submittals shall be as detailed in the Locally Administered Transportation Projects Manual of Procedures. ODOT-Let LPA Projects will follow the Project Development Process.
1404.5 Customization of Review Requirements
The PDP’s phased approach allows for the customization of a project’s review process. It allows for more flexibility between project phases and allows the Project Manager to tailor the process to meet the project’s individual needs.
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
128
The Staged Review Process may be customized by adding review submissions, combining review submissions and/or modifying the content of individual review submissions. Customizations of the Staged Review Process must be listed in the project’s scope of services document. These customizations should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by ODOT personnel prior to scoping. During the scoping process, Consultants are encouraged to submit suggestions for modifications that allow for more effective use of resources, while still providing adequate evaluation of design and environmental issues.
1404.5.1 Combined Reviews
Combined Review submissions are recommended for relatively straightforward projects. Elements from each involved submission must be included in the combined submission. It is not acceptable to disregard elements associated with earlier deliverables and focus only on elements from the later review when they are necessary in the evaluation of the combined review submission (e.g., Path 1 Preliminary Engineering) elements (e.g., Stage 1 Detailed Design).
1404.5.2 Modifications to Design Review Content
It is possible to make modifications to design review content by changing the order in which activities occur in the Staged Review Process. For instance, the timing of a design activity may be modified allowing it to occur earlier, or later, by moving it to another phase in the project development process. This may be justified when particular activities add significant cost to a project’s design as a result of performing the task on multiple alternatives. The postponement of activities to a later phase must not diminish the Design Agency’s ability to evaluate alternatives, or to adequately determine the project’s scope, schedule, and budget. Conversely, review elements should be moved forward in the process when they can be obtained at relatively low costs and would add greatly to the Design Agency’s ability to evaluate alternatives or determine scope, schedule, and budget.  For example, in order to identify the Preferred Alternative, a Path 3 project may require investigating a vertical profile during the development of the Feasibility Study, even though this task is listed under the Alternative Evaluation Report (AER) tasks. Alternatively, to avoid investigating structure details on alternatives which are eliminated, a Path 3 project considering multiple alignments for a stream crossing may delay the Structure Type Study until the AER.  There is a limitation on the modification of design review content. For instance, when federal funding is used for design work, the environmental document must be approved prior to the authorization of final design activities (e.g., Stage 3 Detailed Design) and/or any Right-of-way acquisition.
1404.6 Scheduling
Good scheduling helps a project to run smoothly and helps to ensure it is completed in a timely manner.  When developing schedules, particular attention must be paid to items that fall on the critical path (e.g., Right-of-way acquisition, utility relocation, individual 404/401 permits, etc.) and items that must be completed during a particular time of year (e.g., aerial mapping, ecological studies, etc.)  In ODOT’s Project Development Process, Gantt chart schedules are used to coordinate the various tasks associated with project development against time. Consultants are required to submit updated Gantt chart schedules each month which include baseline, actual, and current finish dates. The Project Manager must accept any modification to the schedule which alters commitment dates.  Projects which are behind schedule must include a recovery plan.
1405 Review Agencies
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
129
With the exception of external agency coordination performed by the Office of Environmental Services, all review submissions must be coordinated by, and are the responsibility of, the District. This ensures consistency of review comments, scope compliance, and project intent.    Submissions may be reviewed by the District Office, Central Office, an external agency, a resource agency, or one contracted by ODOT for all (or part) of the submission. External reviews may be necessary based upon agreement (e.g., Memorandums of Understanding (MOU), Memorandums of Agreement (MOA)). The determination of an external review will be made during the design Scope of Services meeting.
1405.1 Ohio Department of Transportation
The District Project Manager is the first point of contact for all review questions. The Project Manager:</li>
<li>verifies required review information is submitted in accordance with the project schedule.</li>
<li>ensures review comments are appropriately addressed.</li>
<li>coordinates the appropriate and timely execution of reviews, not only within the District, but Central
Office as well.
1405.1.1 Technical Offices and Specialty Areas
Projects prepared by the District office may require a review by a technical office or specialty area.  Figure 1405-1 lists ODOT Central Office Technical Specialty Areas. At the District’s request, these offices/specialty sections will assist in the review of unique or complex items.
1405.1.2 Central Office
Projects prepared by the District Office should be submitted by the Project Manager directly to each involved office, or technical specialty area, for review. Figure 1405-1 lists ODOT Central Office Technical Specialty Areas.  Reviews must be conducted by someone other than the project designer.  For projects developed by a consultant, there are two methods for sending review submissions to Central Office:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Documents are submitted directly to each involved office or technical specialty area. The consultant should provide a copy of all transmittals to the Project Manager.</li>
<li>Multiple copies of the review documents are submitted to the Project Manager for distribution to each involved technical office and/or specialty area.
The consultant Scope of Services document should address which method of submission is desired by the District.
1405.2 Federal Highway Administration
The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is accountable for ensuring that all Federal-aid highway programs are delivered consistent with established requirements. The Federal-Aid Highway Program Stewardship and Oversight Agreement outlines the respective roles and responsibilities of ODOT and the FHWA in administering the federal-aid program. Figure 1405-2 outlines the Federal Oversight determination process.  At the time of programming, the District will determine the level of oversight required on a project and enter it into Ellis. On projects subject to federal oversight, the FHWA and ODOT should discuss which submissions should be sent to the FHWA. For federal oversight projects, a copy of all required review submittals must be furnished directly to the FHWA by the preparing agency, or local government. Due to fluctuations in workloads, the FHWA may request federal oversight on a project that would normally be State administered.
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
130
1405.3 Local Governments
When the Design Agency is working for a local government, the local government may either have review materials processed through its office or have the preparing agency make submittals directly to the District Office. In either case, unless otherwise notified, ODOT will assume the submittal reflects the intent and desires of the local government.
1405.4 Other Governmental Agencies
Review and approval from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR), State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) and Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) may be required.   Other required environmental approvals and agency coordination are detailed in various manuals, and handbooks, published by the Office of Environmental Services.  Submissions to the environmental resource agencies (e.g., the Bureau of Underground Storage Tank Regulation, Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, Ohio Department of Agriculture, National Park Service, State Historic Preservation Office, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency) must be submitted through the Office of Environmental Services. Contact the Office of Environmental Services for more information.
1405.5 Railroads
When railroad property falls within the work limits of a proposed project, the possibility of railroad involvement exists. Rail companies must be informed at an early stage of plan development whenever their facilities may be affected in any manner. Some examples include work on structures passing over a rail line, new grade separations, reconstruction or rehabilitation of existing grade separations, drainage work, removal of Right-of-way encroachments, utility work, etc. In addition, projects with an intersection within the project’s limits, located within 400 feet of an at-grade rail crossing, require coordination with the Ohio Rail Development Commission to determine the need for preemption.  All projects with rail involvement must be coordinated with the Central Ohio Railroad Coordinator who is responsible for preparing, and processing, all railroad construction agreements. The construction agreement process is initiated at Stage 1 and finalized at Stage 3. The District is required to send a copy of the final plans to the affected railroad company.  For projects involving of rail Right-of-way, the involved rail company will be allowed an opportunity to comment on the Right-of-way plans and legal descriptions associated with acquisition of their property.  The Acquisition Support Section in the Office of Real Estate coordinates the acquisition of Right-of-way from rail companies.
1406 Design Review Submittals  Review submissions are designed to ensure that all projects are developed in compliance with the Scope of Services, ODOT standards, and policies. The Project Manager is responsible for verifying that all required review information is submitted in accordance with the project’s schedule, and that review comments are appropriately addressed. Information regarding the content requirements of each review submission can be found within the appropriate ODOT technical manuals and webpages (e.g., Waterway Permits Manual, Right-of-way Plan Manual).
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
131
1406.1 General Requirements
Each review submission includes a list of design activities. Therefore, each project should be scheduled based on its required design activities and anticipated design development timeframes.  There may be instances where specific design recommendations may come from someone other than the Designer of Record responsible for the overall project design. For example, a sub-consultant might prepare the Geotechnical Exploration Report whose recommendations are incorporated into the project’s plans by the prime consultant. To ensure that their recommendations have been correctly interpreted and incorporated into the project’s design, the sub-consultant should be given an opportunity to review the plans prior to their submission to ODOT.  Unless otherwise noted in the Scope of Services document, all review submissions should be sent to the District office. Multiple copies and direct submittals to Central Office and external agency reviewers may be required. Care should be taken to ensure that each submission includes all information required to process the review. Review submissions that lack required information, or contain inaccuracies which preclude meaningful review, will be rejected.  Since right-of-way acquisition is frequently on the critical path for overall project development, preliminary Right-of-way plan preparation and Stage 2 Detailed Design should be developed concurrently.  Compliance Right-of-way plan development will normally occur immediately after preliminary Right-of-way approval.  The following sections provide information for design review submission. No attempt has been made to either detail design standards or to provide guidance on how to evaluate any particular design component, or issue. Design standards are provided in the technical manuals and design policies listed in Figure 1405-1.
1406.1.1 General
All submissions must include the following in the letter of transmittal:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Project identification: County, Route, Section (Street Name), PID number, Federal number or program
(if known).</li>
<li>Identification of the type of review submission</li>
<li>Indication of any local government involvement along with any comments the local government may have
regarding the submission</li>
<li>Explanation of any special items, situations, or potential problem areas</li>
<li>Disposition of previous review comments</li>
<li>A current cost estimate factored up to the year the project will be awarded and indicating reasons for any
significant increase, or decrease in project cost</li>
<li>Identification of all plan sheets, reports, and other materials
When both environmental and design documentation are required to complete a review, all documentation should be submitted at the same time. A sufficient number of copies of all submissions must be provided to allow for adequate review by all involved parties.
1406.1.2 Format
The format and number of copies required for all submissions is determined during the design Scope of Services meeting(s). For plan sets, quarter size 11&#34; x 17&#34; sheets are usually preferred. Plan sets must be bound.  Calculations, reports and other documentation should normally be submitted on 8 1/2&#34; x 11&#34; paper. Large size exhibits, or preliminary design work, may be needed for public involvement meetings. Multiple sets of documents may be required to facilitate the review.  Plan sheet image files shall be provided in PDF format. Text-based documents should be provided as searchable PDF files. With the exception of some local-let projects, plans shall be submitted in a PDF electronic image format
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
132
in accordance with the requirements of the electronic image file submission procedures available on the Office of Contracts website.  The District may consider allowing electronic submittals in addition to, or as a replacement for, paper submittals. The number of paper or electronic copies required for a particular review should be addressed in the Scope of Services document and be based on previous project experience, existing inter-agency agreements, and/or information from the review agency.   All projects requiring submittal of CADD files shall be developed using Bentley in accordance with the Section 1600, Electronic Design Deliverables, and Section 1204, Computer-Aided Drafting and Design (When scoped in the project’s Scope of Services document and in accordance with the Section 1600 Electronic Design Deliverables, and Section 1204, Computer-Aided Drafting and Design, comparable CADD software may be accepted). See Section 1503.1 for more information.  Some external agencies do not allow submission of electronic images. In instances where hard copy (e.g., paper) documents are required, the District CPA will determine whether the hard copy document will be created by the District or by the consultant.
1406.1.3 Engineer’s Seal
All final submissions must be sealed by a Registered Professional Engineer in accordance with the Ohio Administrative Code 4733-23-01. This includes not just final plan sets, but also Access Point Request documents and Design Exceptions. If an Engineer has been hired to prepare plans through the Final Plan Package Submittal, then only the final plans and supporting documentation must be sealed.  Situations may occur where the detailed design will not be developed by the same engineer, or design firm, who prepared the preliminary engineering. In this case, the detailed design Engineers may rely on the preliminary development completed and sealed by the preliminary engineering consultant as the basis for their design. This information should be noted on the Title Sheet of the plans.
1406.2 Stage 1 Detailed Design
1406.2.1 General
Stage 1 Detailed Design begins after the identification of a preferred alternative. It refines and builds upon the preliminary engineering design completed in order to reach a decision on the preferred alternative.  Stage 1 plans are developed to a sufficient level of design detail to ensure that Preliminary Right-of-Way plan development may begin immediately after completion. Construction limits should be accurate; with little or no changes anticipated due to Stage 2 development.  Stage 1 Detailed Design is part of the Preliminary Engineering (PE) Phase of the PDP. Path 1 and Path 2 projects do not typically require a Stage 1 Detailed Design submission. It is required for Path 4 and Path 5 projects, and for most Path 3 projects.
1406.2.2 Stage 1 Detailed Design Activities
Since each project is unique, Project Managers have the flexibility to determine which activities are necessary based on the project’s scope. Therefore, there is no one-size-fits-all when it comes to the tasks necessary to complete a project’s design.  Following are activities are typically part of a Stage 1 Detailed Design:</li>
<li>Design Exception request
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025

1406.3 Preliminary Right-of-way Plan
1406.3.1 General
Preliminary Right-of-Way Plans are required for all projects that involve acquisition of temporary or permanent Right-of-way, and should be prepared in accordance with the Right-of-way Plan Manual, Section 3100. They provide information to define the extent of the right-of-way required to construct and maintain a highway.  Since acquisition of property can be a long process that in many cases dictates the overall schedule of a project prior to construction, preliminary right-of-way plans should be developed concurrently with Stage 2 detailed design. They should incorporate all Stage 2 review comments related to right-of-way issues.
1406.3.2 Preliminary Right-of-way Plan Tasks
For a complete listing of tasks of which should be completed during the development of the Preliminary Right-of-way Plan, consult the SAFe Task List.    Refer to the Office of Real Estate, Right-of-Way Plan Manual, Section 3100, for details regarding Preliminary Right-of-way Plan development.

1407 Miscellaneous Studies
1407.1 Airway/Highway Clearance Analysis
1407.1.1 Introduction
The purpose of an Airway/Highway Clearance Analysis is to determine if a proposed project will encroach into the theoretical approach, or traverse surfaces, of an airport or heliport. When a project is identified as being within 20,000 feet of a public-use or military airport, or heliport, an analysis must be performed to determine if FAA notification is required. The initial determination whether or not a project is within the 20,000-foot distance is to be made at the time of programming, and it should be so noted on the programming forms and in ODOT’s project management system.

The Airway/Highway Clearance Analysis procedures contained in this manual are based on the “Federal Aviation Regulations, Part 77 - Objects Affecting Navigable Airspace.” Information on the location of airports and lengths of runways may be obtained from the “Ohio Airport Directory,” as published by the Ohio Department of Transportation, Office of Aviation.
1407.1.2 Notification Surfaces
The following conditions need to be examined to determine if notification is required.</li>
<li>Any construction or alterations of more than 200 feet in height above ground level.</li>
<li>Any construction or alteration of greater height than an imaginary surface extending outward and upward
at the following slopes:  o 100:1, for horizontal distance of 20,000 feet from the nearest point of the nearest runway, for any
airport with at least one runway with a length of more than 3,200 feet, excluding heliports. o 50:1, for a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet from the nearest point of the nearest runway, for any
airport where the length of the longest runway does not exceed 3,200 feet, excluding heliports. o 25:1, for a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the nearest point of the nearest landing and
takeoff area, for a heliport.
See Figure 1407-1 for a graphical depiction of these surfaces.
1407.1.3 Traverse Way Adjustments
In determining whether any roadway or other traverse way (e.g., railroad, waterway, bikeway, etc.) will violate the limits described in the previous section, it is necessary to include an additional upward height above the traverse way elevation for vehicles that might travel on the facility. The adjustments are as follows:</li>
<li>17 feet for Interstate highways, other freeways, and expressways</li>
<li>15 feet for all other public roadways and commercial driveways</li>
<li>10 feet for all private roads and driveways</li>
<li>23 feet for railroads</li>
<li>an amount equal to the height of the highest mobile object that would normally traverse the facility, for a
waterway or for any other traverse way not previously mentioned
This additional height must be considered to apply over the full width of the traveled portion and the shoulders of the roadway. Figure 1407-1 includes examples of several traverse way adjustments.
1407.1.4 Exceptions to Notification Requirements
FAA notification is not required where one or more of the following applies to the object penetrating the notification surface:</li>
<li>The object is shielded by existing structures of a permanent and substantial character or by natural terrain
or topographic features, of equal or greater height.</li>
<li>The object is located in the congested area of a city, town, or settlement, where it is evident beyond all
reasonable doubt that there could be no adverse effect on safe air navigation.</li>
<li>The object is an antenna of 20 feet or less in height, except one that would increase the height of another
antenna structure.  Figure 1407-2 includes examples of locations where FAA notification is, and is not, required.

1407.1.5 Temporary Structures and Construction Equipment
It is possible that a project located within 20,000 feet of an airport will not require FAA notification for permanent features but will require notification for temporary structures or construction equipment. Figure 1407-3 contains height allowances for equipment or structures associated with various types of construction. These allowances should be used to determine if the notification surface will be penetrated. For short projects (100 feet or less in length), any applicable heights should be considered to apply over the entire length of the project.   Judgment must be used when applying these heights to longer projects. For example, the allowance for equipment used to construct a bridge would only be needed in the vicinity of the bridge; however, the allowance for earth moving and paving equipment should be applied over the entire length. When any doubt exists, consult the Office of Aviation.
1407.1.6 Controlled Areas
Figure 1407-4 displays cross-sectional and profile views of imaginary surfaces that exist above the notification surface. Figure 1407-5 depicts an area at the end of a runway called the Runway Protection Zone (RPZ). Figure 1407-6 contains dimensions defining the sizes of RPZ’s for different facilities. Projects should be designed so that these controlled areas are not penetrated by any features, as the FAA will not normally permit violations.
1407.1.7 FAA Notification/Clearance Procedures
Whenever a project is located within 20,000 feet of a public-use or military airport or heliport, an Airway/Highway Clearance Analysis must be performed. Documentation which provides the information contained in Figure 1407-7 must be supplied. The District will use this information to complete FAA Form 7460-1. The FAA requires the use of English units.   The District will submit the following information to the FAA for approval:</li>
<li>Two completed FAA Form 7460-1&#39;s. One form is for the proposed project and the other form is for the
construction equipment and/or temporary structures.</li>
<li>Latitude, longitude (NAD), and elevation (above mean sea level) of the following points:
o For short bridge projects, 100 feet or less in length: i. Highest point of the superstructure of the bridge.
o For all other projects: i. Beginning of the project ii. End of the project iii. Highest point of the project iv. Closest point to the runway v. Any other points that may be important to the study (e.g., various high points
throughout the project that may penetrate the imaginary surface) vi. Each light tower or signal pole. In addition, include structure number, latitude,
longitude, ground elevation, structure height and overall height vii. Highest point of the superstructure of each bridge  Accuracy of points should be within 50 feet horizontally and 20 feet vertically.</li>
<li>A USGS map of the project location relative to the airport showing a reference for each point listed above.
Instructions on how to file the 7460-1 form with the FAA can be found on the Office of Aviation’s website at:
<a href="https://www.transportation.ohio.gov/programs/aviation/airports/protection-act">https://www.transportation.ohio.gov/programs/aviation/airports/protection-act</a>
When approval (or comments) is received from the FAA, the District Project Engineer will retain the original correspondence and distribute copies to the Office of Aviation and the FHWA (for federal oversight projects only). Submit FAA approvals to the Office of Aviation electronically at the following web address:
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
141
<a href="mailto:Ohio.Airport.Protection@dot.ohio.gov">Ohio.Airport.Protection@dot.ohio.gov</a>
FAA comments will generally relate to certification of the coordinates submitted or the submission of Form 7460-2, Supplemental Notice. The FAA may also request that a light pole, or other similarly tall structure, be visibly marked or possibly reduced in height.  Approvals are valid for a period of eighteen (18) months. The District will monitor project status (sale date) relative to the approval expiration date and submit a request for extension to the FAA at least two (2) weeks prior to the expiration date.
When construction equipment is expected to penetrate the notification surface of a public-use or military airport or heliport, note G118A should be added to the plans. When construction equipment is not expected to penetrate the notification surface, but the project is within the influence area of a public-use or military airport or heliport, note G118B should be used.
1407.1.8 Private Facilities
An Airway/Highway Clearance Analysis is required for private airports and heliports. The notification surfaces detailed in Section 1407.1.2 – Notification Surfaces shall apply to both public and private facilities. If there are any penetrations into the notification surfaces that impact a private facility, coordination with the private owner, and the Office of Aviation, shall be made and note G118C should be added to the plans. Coordination with the FAA is not required.
1407.2 Retaining Wall Justification
A Retaining Wall Justification compares the impacts and costs (both right-of-way and construction) of the project with and without retaining walls. Estimated right-of-way costs are to be provided or verified by the Office of Real Estate.  A Retaining Wall Justification should include:</li>
<li>Plan sheets showing wall and no-wall alternatives, including:
o Approximate construction limits o Right-of-way parcels affected</li>
<li>Cross sections showing wall and no-wall alternatives.</li>
<li>Economic analysis comparing right-of-way and construction costs, with and without the wall.</li>
<li>Discussion of environmental impacts with and without the wall (optional).
1407.3 Service Road Justification Study
Service roads (sometimes called access or frontage roads) are used to: reduce the number of existing access points, connect roads cut off by highway relocation, and to provide access to parcels that would otherwise be landlocked by a highway relocation. The decision to use a service road to decrease the number of existing access points is usually made for safety or capacity reasons, although in some cases it could be based on economics.  Using a service road to connect roads cut off by a relocation is done primarily to provide needed traffic circulation. Providing access via a service road to otherwise landlocked parcels is primarily an economic decision.  Maintenance of service roads by the State is not desirable because, in many cases, these facilities are not readily accessible from a state highway. It is therefore necessary that a statement of acceptance of routine maintenance by a local government agency be obtained.   A Service Road Study Form (see Appendix D) must be completed. In preparing the analysis, maintenance costs related to the service road must be considered. Estimated right-of-way costs are to be provided or verified by the
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
142
Office of Real Estate. For information and guidance on preparing the Service Road Study Form contact the Office of Roadway Engineering.
1407.4 Pedestrian Overpass Justification
A Pedestrian Overpass Justification compares the impacts and costs of a project with and without a pedestrian overpass. A statement of acceptance by a local government agency assuming responsibility for all routine maintenance of the structure and approaches must be obtained. Routine maintenance includes clearing debris from the deck, sweeping, snow and ice removal, minor wearing surface patching, clearing bridge drainage systems, marking decks for traffic control, minor and emergency repairs to railing and appurtenances, emergency patching of deck and maintenance of traffic signal and lighting systems, including the supply of electrical power. For information on Pedestrian Overpasses, refer to Location and Design Manual, Volume 1, Section 306.5.
1407.5 Value Engineering (VE) Studies
Value Engineering (VE) is a systematic analysis by a multi-discipline team which identifies the functions of a project, establishes the worth of that function, generates alternatives through the use of creative thinking, and identifies ways to provide the needed functions at the lowest overall cost, without sacrificing safety, quality, and the environmental attributes of the project.  The Department requires that Value Engineering studies be performed on federally funded projects meeting the following criteria:</li>
<li>All projects on the federal-aid system with an estimated total cost in excess of fifty (50) million dollars
(including design, right-of-way, and construction)</li>
<li>All bridge projects located on the federal-aid system with an estimated cost in excess of forty (40) million
dollars (including design, right-of-way, and construction)</li>
<li>Any other project selected by FHWA
Appropriate timing of VE studies will ensure that there is sufficient information to analyze during the Value Engineering Session and that accepted recommendations can be successfully implemented without impeding the overall project development schedule.  The criteria used to determine if a project qualifies for Value Engineering can be found in ODOT’s Standard Procedure No. 414-001(SP), Design Value Engineering Standard Procedures. The Design Value Engineering Policy can be found in Policy No. 21-006(P).  It is the District’s responsibility to review projects currently programmed in the Planning, Preliminary Engineering, and/or Final Engineering/ROW phase to determine if a project qualifies for Value Engineering. The District Value Engineering Coordinator is also responsible for monitoring project schedules and contacting the Office of Roadway Engineering Value Engineering Coordinator (COVEC) to schedule a Value Engineering Study.  The COVEC oversees ODOT’s VE program, provides assistance to the Districts, ensures that all VE recommendations are fully evaluated, and all accepted recommendations of the VE team are implemented.  Since each project is unique, there may be instances where multiple value engineering studies may be required. Typically, Path 3, and some Path 4, projects that qualify for Value Engineering require only one Value Engineering Study to be performed. More complex Path 4 and Path 5 projects, with extensive impacts, will likely require two Value Engineering studies.    Contact the Office of Roadway Engineering for more information on Value Engineering.

1407.6 Constructability Review
The intent of a Constructability Review is to check the plans for potential construction strategies, techniques and logistical issues. It is an evaluation of the project plans, sometimes supplemented by a site visit conducted by an individual familiar with construction techniques, to evaluate construction means and methods. The Constructability Review also checks construction durations, and alternative designs. It identifies labor and material availability, access for large equipment, project phasing, and the conceptual maintenance of traffic.  The Project Manager will determine if a Constructability Review will be conducted concurrent with the Preliminary Engineering Phase.    To ensure an independent evaluation, constructability reviews should not be conducted by the design consultant who prepared the plans. Designers should routinely consider constructability issues during the normal course of project development.

<h4 id="section-1500-plan-related-actions">Section 1500 Plan Related Actions</h4>
<p>1501 Introduction  There are several actions that are required to complete the processing of a highway construction plan.  Section 1500 includes a discussion of these related actions.
1502 Documentation of Environmental Commitments  Environmental commitments are any agreed upon actions to mitigate (e.g., restore, enhance, avoid, minimize, and/or replace) impacts to the human environment. Environmental Commitments are captured in the environmental document and are the link between the Environmental (EE) phase of the project and the Final Engineering/Right-of-way (FE/RW) and Construction (CO) phases of the Project Development Process (PDP).  To ensure environmental commitments are carried out appropriately, an Environmental Consultation Form (ECF) is to be completed, signed by the District Environmental Coordinator, and submitted with the Plan Package to ODOT’s Office of Contracts. The District Environmental Coordinator will communicate all applicable environmental commitments to designers. Environmental commitments must be incorporated into a plan’s design and/or plan notes so that they can be implemented during construction.  For more information, contact the Office of Environmental Services or see the Office of Environmental Services’ Environmental Commitments Manual.
1503 CADD File Requirements for Design and Construction
1503.1 CADD Software Requirements
All projects requiring submittal of CADD files shall be developed using Bentley in accordance with Section 1204, Computer-Aided Drafting and Design (CADD), Section 1600, Electronic Design Deliverables and Scope of Services. Although ODOT will accept CADD files developed using comparable CADD software, no support, standards, documentation, or guidance of any kind with respect to design and delivery will be provided. For more information, see SECTION 1204, Computer -Aided Drafting and Design (CADD).
1503.2 CADD File Requirements
Unlike electronic image files (i.e., PDF images) that are part of the contract documents, CADD files (i.e., basemap files) provided to contractors are for reference purposes only. In the event that there is a conflict between the CADD files and the bidding documents, the bidding documents shall take precedence.  CADD files, and a Project Index File, shall be provided in accordance with the requirements for Electronic Submittals described in Section 1600, Electronic Design Deliverables, located on the Office of CADD and Mapping Services website, and included in the Final Plan Package submittal.
1503.2.1 Typical Requirements for Projects Following Path 1 of the Project Development Process (PDP)
For projects scoped to Path 1 of the PDP, the following files are typically required for reference purposes only:</p>
<ul>
<li>Existing Plans (Roadway and Bridge)</li>
<li>Designer Office Calculations (such as Pavement, Earthwork, and Structure Quantities)</li>
<li>Final Geotechnical Report(s)
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
160
Most Path 1 projects are simple transportation improvements generated by traditional maintenance and preventative maintenance. They may involve structure or roadway resurfacing and have no right-of-way or utility impacts. However, there are some projects which require more detail in their design than a “typical” Path 1 project but still meet the criteria of a Path 1 project. For these projects, electronic design files (e.g., .gpk, triangle model, ASCII text files, etc.), if generated, shall be submitted with the project’s Plan Package. For example, on projects requiring a Project Site Plan, electronic design files generated during the project’s design are required in the final plan submission. These files will be made available to contractors during ODOT’s construction contract bidding process.    Information to be made available to bidders should be determined, and documented, in the project’s Scope of Services document.  For more detailed information on electronic files required to be submitted with the Final Plan Submission, see Section 1600, the Electronic Design Deliverables.
1503.2.2 Typical Requirements for Projects Following Paths 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the Project Development Process (PDP)
The PDP provides Project Managers with the flexibility to tailor the requirements of a project to meet its individual needs. Therefore, the requirements for each project are based upon the path it is following. Electronic Files (e.g., CADD files, alignment files, basemap files, etc.) shall be in accordance with the requirements for electronic submittals described in Section 1600, Electronic Design Deliverables. Contact the Office of CADD and Mapping Services, CADD Services section with questions.  Although not all-inclusive, following is a listing of files which, if available, shall be made available to bidders:</li>
<li>Plans and Profile Sheets</li>
<li>Cross Section Sheets and Cells</li>
<li>Intersection/Interchange Details</li>
<li>Project Site Plan</li>
<li>Reference Basemap Files</li>
<li>Files for reference purposes only:
o Existing Plans (Roadway and Bridge) o Designer Office Calculations (such as Pavement, Earthwork, and Structure Quantities) o Final Geotechnical Report(s)</li>
<li>All other electronic files shall be in accordance with the requirements for electronic submittals described in Section 1600, Electronic Design Deliverables.</li>
<li>Other files may be required at the District’s discretion, but this should be documented in the project’s scope.  The District CPA may elect to waive all, or a portion of the CADD file requirements (except for the submittal of existing plans and designer office calculations) for projects that have less than one acre of earth disturbed area. Waiver of these requirements shall be noted in the Scope of Services document.  Since each project is unique, information to be made available to bidders should be determined, and documented, in the project’s Scope of Services document.
1503.3 Submission of Files to the District
CADD and electronic image files shall be supplied to ODOT via CD, DVD, or other media as approved by the District, pursuant to the project Scope of Services document.  For detailed information on the electronic files required to be submitted to ODOT, see Section 1600 Electronic Design Deliverables.
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
161
1503.4 Submission of Files to Central Office
The plan package for a project is to be submitted in accordance with the schedule prepared by Central Office and the Districts. The plan package must include documentation confirming that the project is eligible and ready to be advertised for bids.  Submission of the Final Plan Package is part of the Final Engineering /Right-of-Way (FE/RW) Phase of ODOT’s Project Development Process (PDP). Project Managers are required to create and submit the final plan package documentation in electronic format as a single PDF. To reduce the size of PDF files, vectorized elements are preferred to raster PDF, with the exception of the Title Sheet. The Title Sheet is the only document which can be a raster PDF. The District shall review the electronic documents for completeness to ensure that all required files are transmitted to Central Office.    A project’s CADD files, if created, are required to be submitted with the Final Plan Package. ODOT provides CADD files to contractors for reference purposes only. For more details on the electronic files required to be submitted to ODOT, see Section 1600, Electronic Design Deliverables.  All ODOT-let projects shall be submitted to Project Coordination via the ODOT Plan Package Submittal internal SharePoint site located here:

<h4 id="section-1600-electronic-design-deliverables">Section 1600 Electronic Design Deliverables</h4>
<p>1601 General Electronic Design Deliverables Information
1601.1 Introduction
Each project submission includes delivery of electronic files. This section serves to outline the requirements and the formats for delivery of electronic project documents.
1601.2 Electronic Data Submission
The Project Manager shall be the point of contact for all communication between the contractor or consultant, and ODOT. An email notification shall be sent to the Project Manager if compliance with these guidelines is not met.  ODOT reserves the right to reject any electronic data, or files, that do not meet requirements; data and files shall be corrected before resubmission.
1602 Plan Set Requirements  A Plan Set shall be a single PDF Package/Portfolio only if there is more than one individual PDF making up the Plan Set. Otherwise, it shall be a single multi-page pdf.
1602.1 Plan Set
The Plan Set PDF Package/Portfolio can be named initially as follows:
<em>[YYYYMMDD]-[PID]-PlanSet.pdf</em>
Where [YYYYMMDD] is the 8-digit submission date and [PID] is the project identifier.  The Name of the Plan set will change when being submitted to Central Office based on the type of submission it is (Initial Plan Filing, Pre-Addendum, Addendum). See Project Submission Procedure (Internal Link Only) for naming requirements and procedures when making a submission to Central Office. The Project Submission is to be done by the District Project Manager.
1602.2 Plan Set Components and Naming Conventions
When two or more projects are combined to be sold as one construction project, the Plan Set components listed below shall have their name appended with Part#, where # is the sequential numbering for each project. There should still only be one overall Plan Set PDF Package/Portfolio.
1602.2.1 Construction Plan
When generating a PDF plan set, the plan sheets (excluding R/W sheets) within the PDF Package/Portfolio shall be named as follows:
<em>[CTY]-[PID]-Plan.pdf</em>
Where [CTY] is the main county abbreviation listed in ELLIS for the project and [PID] is the project identifier.
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025
166
All signatures within this PDF, requiring a professional seal shall follow the digital signature requirements.
1602.2.2 Right-of-Way Plan Sheets
When generating a PDF plan set, the Right-of-Way portion of the plan set shall be a separate PDF document within the plan set PDF Package/Portfolio and shall be named as follows:
<em>[CTY]-[PID]-Plan-RW.pdf</em>
Where [CTY] is the main county abbreviation listed in ELLIS for the project and [PID] is the project identifier.  While the Right-of-way plan sheets are still considered to be a sub-set of the overall plan sheets, they do not have to be included in the overall sequential numbering of the plan (only the sub-set sheet number is required).  Plan Sheets that are being signed and sealed for the purposes of recording with a county do not have to be digitally signed and shall follow the requirements specified by that recording county.   The R/W Legend Sheet shall still follow all digital signature requirements.
1602.2.3 Signature Sheet
If additional non-sealed signatures (excluding the Director and District Deputy Director) are desired (i.e., city official), they shall be placed on a separate signatures PDF within the plan set PDF Package/Portfolio and shall be named as follows:
<em>[CTY]-[PID]-Signatures.pdf</em>
Where [CTY] is the main county abbreviation listed in ELLIS for the project and [PID] is the project identifier.  Non-sealed signatures are not subject to the digital signature requirements and therefore can follow the criteria or requirements of the entity requesting them.
1602.2.4 Special Provisions
Each special provision for the project shall be a separate PDF document within the Plan Set PDF Package/Portfolio and shall be named as follows:
[CTY]-[PID]-SP-[Desc].pdf  Where [CTY] is the main county abbreviation listed in ELLIS for the project, [PID] is the project identifier, and [Desc] is a short description of the special provision (i.e. WaterWayPermit).
1602.3 Creation of the Plan Set PDF Package/Portfolio
In order to create a PDF Package/Portfolio, a PDF editor application like Bluebeam Extreme or Adobe Pro is required (it cannot be done with free PDF viewers). The design team creating the plans should create the PDF Package/Portfolio. If the design team does not have access to a PDF editor capable of creating a PDF Package/Portfolio then the District Project Manager shall create the PDF Package/Portfolio Plan Set, ensuring all the required documents are contained within and named correctly.
1603 Supporting Documents Requirements
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 3                          January 2025

Supporting documents refer to files that were generated during the creation of contract documents that can include, but are not limited to, CADD files, Excel files and design calculations. All supporting documents relevant to the creation of the Plan Set shall be submitted. These documents shall be submitted as a .zip file and will also contain an Excel file as an index for the contents of the .zip file. The .zip file will be provided at bidding time as reference only material to assist bidders. Supporting documents are required to be submitted at the same time the final Plan Set is submitted. If the project also has design work being done by internal ODOT personnel, and the consultant is working outside ODOT’s ProjectWise data source, then the supporting documents are also required at each staged submission.  Supporting Documents shall be stored within the Project’s Folder Structure. This Project Folder Structure shall follow Section 1204.3.2, Project Directory Structure, of this manual.    Note: All information provided below uses the folder template from the CONNECT OHDOT Workspace.
1603.1 .zip File Creation
The supporting documents .zip file can be created using the OHDOTCEv02_Indexer.exe application. It is provided within the CADD standards. See OhioDOT CADD Wiki Page for information on how to use this application.

All alignment files (existing and proposed), if created, are required for project submittal in the form of a LandXML file.  Horizontal alignments and vertical (profile) alignments shall follow the naming convention defined in Section 1204.3.6.2, Alignment Names for OpenRoads Designer.  LandXML files can be used to import and export horizontal, vertical, and terrain model information between various software packages supporting the LandXML format.   Note:  ODOT cannot guarantee the accuracy of horizontal and vertical alignment information exported to LandXML format and imported into another software package, due to differences in interpretation of the LandXML 1.2 schema between different software packages. The results of a LandXML import should always be checked for accuracy using the content of the alignment basemap file, or the contract plans.  Only one horizontal alignment should be contained within a single LandXML file. Each horizontal alignment LandXML file should also contain its associated vertical alignments if they exist.
1603.2.4 Surface Files
All surface files (existing and proposed), if created, are required for project submittal in the form of a LandXML file. Only one surface should be contained within a single LandXML file.

G105 – SURVEYING PARAMETERS Designer Note:   Use note G105, unless otherwise directed by the District Survey Operations Manager. Projects should have utilized Section 2000, Survey and Mapping Specifications, of the L&amp;D Volume 4 Manual on the Office of CADD and Mapping Services’ website. Specify primary project control parameters and provide a table in the plans with the following information for primary project control monuments, including azimuth marks and temporary benchmarks: Point Number, Grid Coordinates (Northing, Easting), Scaled Coordinates (Northing, Easting), Elevation, and Description of Monument. At a minimum, the Description of Monument in the table shall indicate the type of monument (i.e., iron pin, concrete monument, etc.) and whether the monument is for project control or traverse purposes. If a Monument, Type B, is used for project control, do not provide an elevation in the Elevation column of the table. Use of a Monument, Type B, establishes horizontal control only. A separate vertical benchmark (i.e., aluminum disc on bridge abutment) will need to be included in the table.  Project control is typically established prior to construction.  If the designer determines that the location of the monuments associated with project control may be disturbed by the Contractor’s construction activities, provide quantities for resetting the monuments in the plans according to the Construction and Material Specifications (C&amp;MS), Item 623, Construction Layout Stakes and Survey Monuments. Standard Construction Drawing RM-1.1 and Section 2000, Survey and Mapping Specifications, of the L&amp;D Volume 4 Manual provide further information regarding project control.
