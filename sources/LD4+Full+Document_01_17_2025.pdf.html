Glossary of Terms
Azimuth Mark: A Type ‘A’ or Type ‘B’ project control monument set at the end points of the project for use as a ‘backsight’ point.
Approximate Location: The immediate area within the perimeter of a proposed excavation site where the underground utility facilities are located.
Benchmark: A relatively permanent object, natural or artificial, bearing a marked point whose elevation is above or below a referenced datum with a known published elevation.   Check points: 3-dimensional positions obtained independently of survey points by traditional ground surveying, Real Time Kinematic GNSS surveying or Static GNSS.  Check points are used to verify the accuracy of the TIN.     Combined Scale Factor: A conversion factor that uses the combination of the Grid Scale factor and the Elevation Scale Factor of a point to reduce horizontal ground distances to grid distances.   Conventional Mapping Survey: A Conventional mapping survey is the collection of points to define the features (natural, manufactured, or both) of a physical surface that is collected directly from ground control, using conventional survey equipment, and is physically measured using a total station, Terrestrial Scanner, GNSS equipment or Hydrographic equipment.  Department: The Department of Transportation, State of Ohio.    Digital Terrain Model (DTM): A bare earth model of the earth that can be used in CADD programs. (Vegetation and other objects/artifacts are removed digitally from the surface)  DTM Accuracy Class: A specific area within the mapping limits with an assigned maximum allowable Dz and RMSE.  The number of areas and the DTM accuracy class for each area is set by the District Survey Operations Manager.   Dz: Mathematical difference between elevations of check points and elevations produced from the TIN (created from the Survey Points) at the exact horizontal location.   Differential Leveling: Determining the difference in elevation between two points by the sum of incremental vertical displacements of a graduated rod.      Elevation Scale Factor: A multiplier used to change horizontal ground distances to geodetic (ellipsoid) distances.
Excavation: The use of hand tools, powered equipment, or explosives to move earth, rock, or other materials in order to penetrate or bore or drill into the earth, or to demolish any structure whether or not it is intended that the demolition will disturb the earth. &#34;Excavation&#34; includes such agricultural operations as the installation of drain tile but excludes agricultural operations such as tilling that do not penetrate the earth to a depth of more than twelve inches. &#34;Excavation&#34; excludes any activity by a governmental entity which does not penetrate the earth to a depth of more than twelve inches. &#34;Excavation&#34; excludes coal mining and reclamation operations regulated under Chapter 1513 of the Revised Code and rules adopted under it.
Excavator: The person or persons responsible for making the actual excavation.
Geodetic Datum:
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 4                    January 2025
8</p>
<ol>
<li>“A set of constants specifying the coordinate system used for geodetic control, i.e., for calculating the
coordinates of points on the Earth.”</li>
<li>“The datum, as defined in (1), together with the coordinate system and the set of all points and lines
whose coordinates, lengths, and directions have been determined by measurement or calculation.”
Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS): Any satellite system which can be used to determine a precise location on the surface of the Earth.  The US system is known as NAVSTAR Global Positioning System (GPS).  The Russian system is known as the GLObal’naya NAvigatsionnaya Sputnikovaya Sistema or GLONASS.  The European Space Agency system is known as GALILEO. The China National Space Administration system is known as BeiDou.    Hydrographic Survey: A survey having for its principal purpose the determination of data relating to bodies of water, and which may consist of the determination of one or several of the following classes of data; depth of water and configuration of bottom; directions and force of current; heights, times and water stages; and location of fixed objects for survey and navigation purposes.   Internal Navigation System (INS): A collection of sensors (typically a GNSS receiver and Internal Measurement Unit (IMU) or some combination thereof) that provide the positional information of a data collecting device (position and attitude) without direct observation of project control. These systems are often paired with cameras and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) for mapping surveys.  Improvement: Any construction, reconstruction, improvement, enlargement, alteration, or repair of a building, highway, drainage system, water system, road, street, alley, sewer, ditch, sewage disposal plant, water works, and all other structures or works of any nature.  INS-Based Mapping Surveys: The collection of points to define the features (natural, manufactured, or both) of a physical surface that is carried out without the direct observation of geodetic/primary control points. The INS-based mapping survey collection equipment relies on positioning based on INS solutions and/or mapping control points. Examples may include Aerial Mapping Surveys, Mobile Mapping Surveys, UAS-based photogrammetry, etc.  LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging): A remote sensing method that uses light as a pulsed laser to measure variable distances to the Earth’s surface.
Multipath (Multipath Error):  The error that results when a reflected GNSS signal is received.  When the signal reaches the receiver by two or more different paths, the reflected paths are longer and cause incorrect pseudoranges or carrier phase measurements and subsequent positioning errors. Multipath is mitigated with various preventive antenna designs and filtering algorithms.   Nondestructive Manner: Using low-impact, low risk technologies such as hand tools, or hydro or air vacuum excavation equipment.  Ohio County Coordinate System (OCCS): The Ohio County Coordinate System (OCCS) is a set of conformal map projections designed by ODOT’s Office of CADD and Mapping Services to provide a series of low distortion projections for the use of Ohio stakeholders. The OCCS can be used for surveying, engineering, GIS, precision agriculture, Emergency Management, and other applications where accurate maps are required. The OCCS is a set of conformal map projections that use county boundaries as their zone widths. The goal of the OCCS is to limit linear distortion between grid and ground to a point where it is negligible, eliminating the need to scale grid coordinates to obtain accurate ground distances.   OPUS Static: The National Geodetic Survey’s On-Line Positioning User Service (OPUS). OPUS accepts a user’s GPS tracking data. It uses corresponding data from the National CORS Network (NCN) to compute 3-
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 4                    January 2025
9
dimensional positional coordinates of the user’s submitted data. OPUS processes a 3-dimensional coordinate with an accuracy of a few centimeters for data sets spanning 2 hours or more.
OPUS-RS: A rapid static form of the National Geodetic Survey’s On-Line Positioning User Service (OPUS). OPUS-RS accepts a user’s GPS tracking data and uses corresponding data from the National CORS Network (NCN) to compute 3-dimensional positional coordinates of the user’s submitted data. OPUS-RS can process a 3-dimensional coordinate with an accuracy of a few centimeters for data sets spanning as little as 15 minutes.   Planimetric Features: Existing 2-dimensional features collected with traditional ground surveying, Real Time Kinematic GNSS surveying, or Photogrammetry for use in engineering projects (example:  existing pavement edge line).     Planimetric Check points: 2-dimensional positions obtained independently of the planimetric feature data collection. Use traditional ground surveying or Real Time Kinematic GNSS surveying.    Planimetric Accuracy Detail Class: The required number of detailed features to be collected.  The District Survey Operations Manager assigns the mapping an accuracy detail class based on the final use of the mapping product.   Project Benchmark: A vertical position transferred from a primary project control monument for use on a specific project.    Project Development Process (PDP): The process used by The Ohio Department of Transportation to develop and manage construction projects. 5 Paths categorize ODOT projects Path 1 being the most straightforward ODOT project to Path 4 and Path 5 being ODOT’s most complex projects.     Project Adjustment (scale) Factor: The inverse of the Combined Scale factor (1/Combined Scale Factor) used to convert grid distances and coordinates to ground distances and coordinates.     Position Dilution of Precision (PDOP): A numerical representation of the predicted accuracy of a geodetic position determined from GNSS satellites.  The term represents the quality of the satellite geometry with respect to the receiver location.  A PDOP of 3 or less will generally ensure the highest survey quality accuracy.
Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) GNSS Survey: A method of determining relative positions between known control and unknown positions using carrier phase measurements. A base station at the known point transmits corrections to the roving receiver offering high-accuracy positions in real-time.     Right of Way Survey: A survey performed to lay out an acceptable route for an easement or right of way for a road, pipeline, utility, or transmission line. This survey would include establishing of all boundary lines and road crossings along the route.    Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): Mathematical calculation that describes horizontal and vertical mapping accuracy encompassing both random and systematic errors.    RTN GNSS Survey: A real-time geodetic survey that uses multiple survey-grade satellite receivers at surrounding CORS to determine an accurate “rover” position. The CORS data and the rover location are sent to a remote server where specialized software generates correctors. The correctors are then streamed via various communications technologies to the rover to yield enhanced three-dimensional positions. RTN-derived positions can be categorized as a “network” solution.  Static GNSS Survey: A geodetic survey that uses survey-grade satellite receivers to collect satellite data on a fixed-point requiring post-processing to determine position.

Temporary Benchmark: A vertical position transferred from a primary project control monument for use on a specific project.  Tolerance Zone: The site of the underground utility facility including the width of the underground utility facility plus eighteen inches on each side of the facility.  Underground Utility Facility: Includes any item buried or placed below ground or submerged under water for use in connection with the storage or conveyance of water or sewage; electronic, telephonic, or telegraphic communications; television signals; electricity; crude oil; petroleum products; artificial or liquefied petroleum; manufactured, mixed, or natural gas; synthetic or liquefied natural gas; propane gas; coal; steam; hot water; or other substances. &#34;Underground utility facility&#34; includes all operational underground pipes, sewers, tubing, conduits, cables, valves, lines, wires, worker access holes, and attachments, owned by any person, firm, or company. &#34;Underground utility facility&#34; does not include a private septic system in a one-family or multi-family dwelling utilized only for that dwelling and not connected to any other system.  Utility: Any owner or operator, or an agent of an owner or operator, of an underground utility facility, including any public authority that owns or operates an underground utility facility. &#34;Utility&#34; does not include the owners of the following types of real property with respect to any underground utility facility located on that property:</li>
<li>The owner of a single-family or two-, three-, or four-unit residential dwelling.</li>
<li>The owner of an apartment complex.</li>

2005.5 Area
Furnish units in square feet to the nearest square foot, in acres to the nearest thousandth (e.g.  0.001) of an acre.
2005.6 Volume
Furnish volumes to the nearest cubic yard unless otherwise stated.
2005.7 Horizontal/Vertical Positions
Furnish Ohio State Plane or OCCS coordinates for all survey control points, Right-of-Way, Centerline, and Boundary monuments that will be shown on any recorded documents and scaled using a project adjustment factor or in an ODOT-approved alternate projection in both metric and U.S. survey feet. Meters shall be shown to the nearest thousandth (e.g., 0.001) of a meter. U.S. survey feet shall be delivered to the nearest thousandth (e.g., 0.001) of a foot. The format for reporting all Horizontal and Vertical positions in OCCS, State Plane or scaled shall be Point Number/Northing coordinate/Easting coordinate/Elevation/Code/Attribute Pairs (if applicable) (P,N,E,Z,D,A1,A2,etc.).
2006 Types of Surveys
2006.1 General
The following survey types are those most commonly performed by ODOT. There are specialty surveys that may fall outside of these categories. The requirements for these specialty surveys will be determined on a project-by-project basis and implemented through the scope of services.
2006.2 Control Surveys
As the National Geodetic Survey (NGS) moves closer to the modernization of the National Spatial Reference System (NSRS), i.e., transitioning from NAD 83 and NAVD 88 to NATRF 2022 and NAPGD 2022, the establishing of control that will last the duration of the project will become critical.
2006.2.1 General
Control Surveys establish coordinate positions (e.g., northings, eastings, and elevations) on strategically located monuments throughout a project. Control Surveys govern all survey work that follows, including mapping, and construction layout.
2006.2.2 Project Control
The purpose of a geodetic/primary control survey is to establish a network of physically monumented coordinate points in and along a highway corridor that provide a common horizontal and vertical datum for the entire project. The geodetic control survey offers the means for tying all the geographic features and design elements of a project to one common horizontal and vertical reference system. The geodetic/primary control survey is performed at a higher level of accuracy and monumentation than the INS-based mapping control; the INS-based mapping control survey shall be considered secondary control.
2006.2.2.1 General
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 4                    January 2025
15
For projects where no ODOT geodetic/primary control survey has been completed, the District Survey Operations Manager shall be contacted, and a determination made if a geodetic/primary control survey is to be completed prior to the aerial control survey. ODOT discourages performing any INS-based mapping survey without a previously established geodetic/primary control survey network. This causes accuracy and coordinate conversion problems later in the project&#39;s progression.  Position all monuments following this specification.  Previously established monuments may be used if those monuments were constructed, positioned, and verified according to this specification. Ensure existing monuments are in good condition and stable.
2006.2.2.2 Geodetic Project Control
Geodetic Control is required for, and will govern, the positioning for all ODOT Path 4 or 5 projects greater than 1 mile in length, and should also be used for any projects, regardless of the path, that are planned to span more than one year. All ODOT projects will be positioned based on the most current horizontal and vertical datums established by the National Geodetic Survey (NGS), and as set forth in Section 2004, Datums, Coordinate Systems, and Positioning Parameters of this document. For stability of the control network, monuments should be set outside of the active construction area to maintain and preserve the integrity of the monument location.  Path 4 &amp; 5 projects greater than 1 mile in length but less than 5 miles in length shall have a minimum of 5 Geodetic Control monuments separate from the Primary Project Control. Projects greater than 5 miles in length will require additional pairs of Geodetic Control Monuments every 2.5 miles. Path 4 and 5 projects less than 1 mile in length shall have a minimum of three type A monuments set in locations that will protect them from being destroyed during construction activities.   Geodetic Control monuments should be set outside of the project limits to encompass the entire project within the control network (see Figure 1 below). Ease of accessibility and the ability to preserve the monuments’ integrity should be taken into consideration when setting Geodetic Control to ensure the project has a stable control network available through the construction phase of the project. One Geodetic Control monument shall be set near the center of the project in an area where the monument can be protected from construction activities. This monument will serve as the primary source of vertical control for the project. Care should be taken to ensure this monument remains intact throughout the project’s life cycle.  Geodetic Control monuments should have a sufficient design, material, and construction to maintain their horizontal and vertical position throughout the project’s life span. The project surveyor may use existing monuments (e.g., NGS horizontal control or benchmarks, County Geodetic Control monuments or PLSS monuments) or set type A monuments if no other options are available.

2006.2.2.3 Primary Project Control
Primary Project Control Monuments are monuments set along the project corridor used exclusively to collect topographic, boundary, and utility data and control construction activities. Primary Project Control should be established with a minimum of three monuments set outside the construction limits of the project. Primary project control shall be constructed to remain stable and last the duration of the project. Primary Project Control shall be set and positioned based on the Geodetic Control if used, or by methods outlined in Section 2006.2.2.5 Observation Methods to Establish Control on Path 1 through 3 Projects. Ensure all topographic, boundary, and utility data is collected and adjusted relative to the established Primary Control Monuments. Construct Primary Project Control Monuments flush to the ground according to details shown in Appendix F.    Primary Project Control Monuments should be positioned so that they:</li>
<li>Are intervisible.</li>
<li>Are able to be used with conventional survey equipment.</li>
<li>Have a clear view of the sky to reduce the potential for GNSS multipath signals.
The placement of Primary Project Control Monuments is dependent upon the project length and should be set at a maximum of ½ mile intervals. Furnish Geodetic/Primary Project Control Monuments per the following table:   **Project Category

2006.2.2.4 Observation Methods to Establish Geodetic Control on Path 4 and 5 Projects</li>
<li>Static GNSS Surveys [Required on Path 4 and 5 projects, Recommended on Path 3 projects]. All control points need a minimum of 3 GNSS sessions observed on three separate days within a 4-week period. Use survey-grade GNSS receivers and antennas following Section 2009, Survey and Mapping Equipment. Use one of the following methods:
o OPUS Solution for all Control Points  ▪ Collect a minimum of 3 sessions of static GNSS data following NGS requirements for
an OPUS static session for each Geodetic Control Monument. Ensure the survey equipment is removed and reinstalled over the monument between sessions.  Ensure proper GNSS survey planning to achieve the required data quality as outlined in this specification. Consider the following when planning the GNSS survey: positional dilution of precision (PDOP), number of satellites, mask angle, collection rate, multipath, solar activity, etc.
o Base Receiver Setup/CORS with Rover unit collecting PPK data  ▪ Establish a base receiver by collecting the Geodetic Control Monument near the
center of the project using a minimum of 3 static GNSS sessions as described above or a nearby CORS as a base. Simultaneously collect the remaining Geodetic Control and/or Primary Control points using a GNSS rover collecting fast-static data. Collect three individual sessions on each Geodetic Control and/or Primary Control point using fast-static data for a minimum of 20 minutes plus 1 minute per kilometer over 15 kilometers of baseline between the occupied control points.</li>
<li>Traversing
o Conduct a conventional survey traverse using an Electronic Total Station defined in Section 2009.2.2, Total Stations. A minimum of 2 direct/2 reverse angles and five distance measurements shall be observed and averaged for the final observation of each control point.
o Closed loop traverses or ties to known control points at the beginning and end of each project should be used to adjust the traverse for errors.
Note: At least two monuments need to be tied to the NSRS, and the traverse transformed and adjusted to their positions.
2006.2.2.5 Observation Methods to Establish Control on Path 1 through 3 Projects</li>
<li>ODOT RTN Surveys [For use on Path 1-3 projects only, not to be used on Path 4 or 5 projects]
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 4                    January 2025
18
o For use on Path 1-3 projects only collect the Northing, Easting, and Elevation coordinates using 5-second observations at a 1-second epoch rate. Collect a minimum of 12 observations for each project control monument. Note: If more than 20 observations are needed to meet the minimum RMSE requirements, consider changing the control location and contact the district Survey Operations Manager.  Collect four observations rotating the rod 90 degrees between each observation, remove the rod and break initialization, repeat this observation procedure until 12 positions have been recorded. Consider the following when planning and performing RTN surveys: positional dilution of precision (PDOP), number of satellites, mask angle, multipath, solar activity, etc. A minimum of 9 observations must be included in the RMSE calculations that meet the required accuracy.</li>
<li>RTK Surveys [For use on Path 1-3 projects only, not to be used on Path 4 or 5 projects]
o Establish a base receiver by collecting 3 GNSS static sessions that meet NGS requirements for an OPUS static session, on one control point. While the receiver is collecting static data perform an RTK survey on the remaining control points. Repeat with each static data collection session so that every control point has a minimum of 3 RTK/static positions.</li>
<li>Traversing
o Conduct a conventional survey traverse using an Electronic Total Station defined in Section 2009.2.2 Total Stations. A minimum of 2 direct/2 reverse angles and five distance measurements shall be observed and averaged for the final observation of each control point.
o Closed loop traverses or ties to known control points at the beginning and end of each project should be used to adjust the traverse for errors.
Note: At least two monuments need to be tied to the NSRS, and the traverse transformed and adjusted to their positions.
2006.2.2.6 Static GNSS Data Processing</li>
<li>OPUS Solution for all Control Points
o Process the collected data to determine the Northing, Easting, and Elevation (Orthometric Height) for each session using National Geodetic Survey’s OPUS (Online Positioning User Service). Use the rapid or precise ephemeris only. Ensure the correct antenna height, make, and model is utilized. Use the same three nearest CORS base stations and standard logging rates when processing a primary project control point in OPUS.  The user must manually select the CORS used in the OPUS processing.</li>
<li>Base Receiver Setup with Rover unit collecting PPK data
o Establish the base station coordinates to post-process GNSS baselines by submitting the GNSS data RINEX files to OPUS as described for OPUS Static solutions. Process the collected GNSS data by importing the data into GNSS post-processing software such as Trimble Business Center, Leica Infinity, or MAGNET, and post-process the GNSS baselines through the appropriate post-processing software. Calculate the positions of three observations per point and calculate the RMSE value to ensure the control point meets the ODOT Survey and Mapping Specifications for a type A monument.</li>
<li>CORS with Rover unit collecting PPK data
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 4                    January 2025
19
o Use the published coordinate values of the nearest CORS to post-process GNSS baselines. Process the collected GNSS data by importing the data into post-processing software such as Trimble Business Center, Leica Infinity, or MAGNET. Post-process the GNSS baselines through the appropriate post-processing software. Calculate the positions of three observations per point and calculate the RMSE value to ensure the control point meets the ODOT Survey and Mapping Specifications for a type A monument.
2006.2.2.7 Coordinate Statistical Analysis
Calculate the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for each coordinate component (Northing, Easting, and Elevation) at each Primary Project Control Monument as shown in Appendix E – Example GNSS Coordinate Statistical Analysis:      Ensure the RMSE for the Northing, Easting, and Elevation components do not exceed the maximum allowable RMSE for all project control monuments according to the following:
Coordinate Component  Maximum Allowable RMSE
Northing   0.029 feet [0.0088 meters]
Easting  0.029 feet [0.0088 meters]
Elevation  0.039 feet [0.0119 meters]
Table 2 See Appendix B for RMSE Calculation
2006.2.2.8 Geodetic/Primary Project Control Monument Horizontal Coordinates
The Northing and Easting of the Geodetic/Primary Project Control Monument coordinates are determined by taking the average of each coordinate component from the solutions that meet the RMSE requirements as specified in 2006.2.2.7 Coordinate Statistical Analysis.
2006.2.2.9 Geodetic/Primary Project Control Monument Vertical Coordinates
Establish the elevations of Geodetic/Primary Project Control Monuments or their associated project benchmarks by differential leveling. Refer to 2006.3 Differential Leveling for leveling procedures.   Differential leveling for Geodetic/Primary Project Control Monuments and project benchmarks will originate from, and close on, the Geodetic Control Monument at the center of the project on Path 4 or 5 projects or the Primary Project Control Monument with the lowest Elevation RMSE value nearest to the center of the project on Path 1-3 projects. Level through all Geodetic and/or Primary Project Control Monuments and project benchmarks. Hold the elevation values established by differential leveling for all Geodetic and Primary Project Control Monuments. As a check, compare the leveled elevations to the GNSS determined elevations from 2006.2.2.7 Coordinate Statistical Analysis. Highlight any differences that exceed 0.10 U.S. Survey Foot.
2006.2.2.10 INS-based Mapping Control (Aerial photo and Mobile Mapping targets)
Aerial photo and Mobile Mapping targets are used to georeferenced images and point cloud data and correctly align and orient individual photos and mobile LiDAR individual scans to other photos and scans. Photo and LiDAR targets are considered secondary control and shall be positioned from and have a direct tie to the primary and/or geodetic control.
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 4                    January 2025
20
2006.2.2.10.1 Photo Targets
Place aerial targets at locations easily identified in aerial photographs. When possible, place all targets within the public right-of-way. Obtain permission prior to placing targets on private property.   The preferred target for ODOT internally acquired aerial photography is a 3 foot by 3 foot cross, 4 inches in width. Use white thermoplastic material thoroughly adhered to the pavement. Other target sizes, shapes, or material may be utilized provided they are clearly visible in aerial photographs. Furnish a PK nail driven flush to the ground at the center of the target.      Use a temporary cloth aerial target for non-pavement applications. Ensure the surface is relatively level.  Pull the cloth target tight and securely stake the target to the ground.
2006.2.2.10.2 Picture Points in lieu of targets
Furnish picture point positions if aerial targets are not utilized. Select picture points that can easily be identified on the aerial photographs. Ensure the selected position is not obscured by shadows or directly adjacent to an object extending above the ground by more than 6 inches. Acceptable picture points include, but are not limited to the following:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Sidewalk corners 2.   Stop bar pavement markings  3.   Tip of pavement marking arrows 4.   Concrete pad corners 5.   Parking lot pavement markings 6.   Top of grate corner for catch basins
Furnish a sketch of each picture point feature. Indicate the location of the surveyed point on the sketch. In lieu of a sketch, provide a photo of the Aerial Picture Point showing the point used in the photo.
2006.2.2.10.3 Aerial Photo Alignment Point Surveys
Collect coordinates and elevations at the center of the cross (aerial target) or at the selected picture point using conventional or GNSS survey equipment. Ensure all photo alignment points are positioned relative to the primary and/or geodetic project control. Differential leveling of photo alignment targets is not necessary due to the fact that the aerial photos are only used to determine horizontal locations of mapping features. Document the survey procedures and methods used.  Use the following survey feature codes when collecting aerial photo alignment targets:
2006.2.2.10.4 Mobile Mapping LiDAR target Alignment Point Surveys
For ODOT internally collected data, provide chevron targets with a minimum tail of 2 foot by 6 inches wide, for aligning mobile mapping scans by setting targets at 600-foot intervals along the outside edges of pavement along the alignment to be mapped. Targets should be placed in a manner that makes them visible in as many scans as possible. Acquire horizontal coordinates on targets through GNSS or conventional
Description Feature Code Target AERTAR Picture Point AERPP

surveys. Elevations of targets should be acquired through differential leveling. Other target sizes, shapes, or material may be utilized provided they are clearly visible within the point cloud.
2006.2.2.11 Intermediate Project Control
Intermediate project control for surveying purposes is to be positioned relative to the Geodetic/Primary Project Control.
2006.2.2.12 Project Adjustment Factor (Grid to Ground Multiplier)
The Project Adjustment Factor shall be documented and used for all projects using State Plane Coordinates scaled to Ground. The Project Adjustment Factor shall be calculated by taking the inverse of the combined scale factor (1/ (coordinate scale factor x ellipsoid height scale factor)). Scale the project about the origin of the Zone of the State Plane Coordinate system (0, 0). Provide Project Adjustment Factor to the 8th decimal place. If a Project Adjustment Factor is required, use one of the following methods for establishing the combined scale factor:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The Latitude of the center Geodetic Control Monument or Primary Project Control Monument closest to the center of the project shall be used to calculate the Project Adjustment Factor for all projects regardless of the method used to locate the monument or method used to determine the Project Adjustment Factor. An ellipsoid height that is a good representation of the average height of the project site shall be used to calculate the ellipsoid height scale factor.</li>
<li>Project Adjustment Factor may be derived by other means with approval of the District Survey Operations Manager (e.g., Data Collector solution, TBC, Infinity, Magnet tools) based on GNSS data collected for any individual point. The control point used should meet the RMSE requirements as reported by OPUS or OPUS-RS.
Projects completed using Ohio County Coordinate System projections are not to be scaled using a Project Adjustment Factor.
2006.2.2.13 Site Calibration
Site Calibration: Observe a minimum of 4 control points to establish a horizontal site calibration and 5 control points to establish a vertical site calibration. The entire project should lie within the control point network. Hold the initial scale of the site calibration fixed at 1 to determine if the horizontal and vertical residuals of the control points are within the current RMSE tolerances. If one or more control points are out of the current RMSE tolerances they can be discarded, and another point can be added to the calibration. If you are performing a Site Calibration on the Grid Coordinates, the GNSS observed Site Calibration Coordinates and the Horizontal and Vertical Residual, shall be included in the final deliverables to the Survey Operations Manager. Consult the Survey Operations Manager regarding Site Calibrations that need to be performed on ODOT projects.

2007 Boundary Surveys
2007.1 General
ODOT surveying and mapping projects may require the location, retracement and establishment of boundaries including private and public properties, federal, state, county and municipal boundaries, public land subdivisions, highway alignments, easements, etcetera. Ensure all ODOT boundary surveys originate from monumentation constructed and/or positioned according to this specification. Ensure conformance to all county, municipal and jurisdictional survey requirements for the project location. Ensure all work is performed in conformance with O.A.C. 4733 &amp; O.R.C. 4733 and the ODOT Right-of-Way Design Manual.
2007.2 Boundary Surveys
Boundary surveys are required for all parcels that may be legally affected, altered or transferred, either temporarily or permanently, as part of an ODOT project. Refer to the project scope of services or the District Survey Operations Manager for further project-specific information. All boundary surveys shall be tied to the Geodetic and/or Primary Project Control.
2007.3 Right of Way &amp; Highway Centerline Surveys
Boundary surveys are required for all parcels that may be legally affected, altered or transferred, either temporarily or permanently, as part of an ODOT project. Refer to the project scope of services or the District Survey Operations Manager for further project-specific information. All boundary surveys shall be tied to the Geodetic and/or Primary Project Control.
2008 Mapping Surveys
2008.1 General
A mapping survey is the collection of points to define the features (natural, manufactured, or both) of a physical surface. This section is divided into different methodologies in which these features are collected:</li>
<li>INS-Based Mapping Surveys: An INS-Based Mapping Survey is the collection of points to define the features (natural, manufactured, or both) of a physical surface that is carried out without the direct observation of geodetic/primary control points. The equipment used in INS-based mapping survey collection relies on positioning based on INS solutions and/or mapping control points. Examples may include Aerial Mapping Surveys, Mobile Mapping Surveys, UAS-based photogrammetry, etc.</li>
<li>Conventional Mapping Survey: A Conventional mapping survey is the collection of points to define
the features (natural, manufactured, or both) of a physical surface that is collected directly from ground control, using conventional survey equipment, and is physically measured using a total station, Terrestrial Scanner, or GNSS equipment. Conventional mapping surveys do not require separate, independent ground control for controlling and verifying mapping accuracies (due to the ability of the equipment to observe/occupy project control directly). Examples may include conventional topographic surveys and hydrographic surveys.
All ground control work associated with positioning INS-based mapping surveys shall be directly supervised and certified by a professional surveyor licensed in the State of Ohio.

2008.2 INS-Based Mapping Surveys
All INS-based mapping surveys must abide by the following absolute accuracy classes outlined in 2008.2.1 DTM Vertical Accuracy and 2008.2.2 Horizontal Planimetric Accuracy. The testing procedures necessary for all INS-Based Mapping Surveys and are outlined in Appendix B – Example RMSE Calculation for Vertical DTM &amp; Horizontal Planimetric Features. Conventional Mapping Surveys must utilize established processes and internal checks to meet the accuracy classes outlined in the following sections.
2008.2.1 DTM Vertical Accuracy
DTM vertical accuracy shall be uniformly tested amongst all INS Based Mapping Surveys to meet the project’s requirements.   Checkpoints used to verify INS Based Mapping Surveys should be dispersed throughout the project and collected by an independent source of higher accuracy.</li>
<li>Independent Source of Higher Accuracy: The independent source of higher accuracy shall be acquired separately from data used in the aero-triangulation solution or other production procedures. The independent source of higher accuracy shall be of the highest accuracy feasible and practicable to evaluate the accuracy of the dataset. Unless otherwise specified, these points shall be located using techniques described in Section 2006.2 Control Surveys of this document. (FGDC, 1998, Appendix 3 Section 1)</li>
<li>Checkpoint Location: Due to the diversity of project limits and requirements, it is unrealistic to outline the exact location of independent checkpoints. As a guideline, checkpoints should be distributed more densely in the vicinity of important features. They may be more sparsely distributed in areas that have limited influence on the project. Attempt to maintain equal dispersion through the corridor limits. For rectangular-based project limits (as opposed to corridor limits), check points may be distributed so that points are spaced at intervals of at least 10% of the diagonal distance across the dataset and at least 20% of the points are located in each quadrant of the dataset. Checkpoint quantities must follow the quantity calculations below. (ASPRS, 2014, Section C.4)
o Vertical Checkpoints: Vertical checkpoints shall be established at locations that minimize interpolation errors. Vertical checkpoints shall be surveyed on flat or uniformly sloped open terrain and with slopes of 25% or less and must avoid vertical artifacts or abrupt changes in elevation, as noted in ASPRS (2014, Section 7.9). In a single checkpoint location, points shall be spaced apart by five ft. with a maximum of four points per location.
Datasets shall be tested for both vegetated and non-vegetated vertical accuracy:</li>
<li>Non-Vegetated Vertical Accuracy (NVA) – The vertical accuracy at the 95% confidence level in non-vegetated open terrain, where errors should approximate a normal distribution.
o Non-Vegetated land cover is categorized as bare soil, sand, rock, asphalt, concrete surfaces, etc.</li>
<li>Vegetated Vertical Accuracy (VVA) – An estimate of the vertical accuracy, based on the 95th percentile, in vegetated terrain where errors do not necessarily approximate a normal distribution.
o Vegetated land cover is to include grass areas, tall weeds, crops, brush lands, etc.
To determine the minimum number of checkpoints, use the following formula:
Minimum Number of Non-Vegetated Points = 20+2<em>x
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 4                    January 2025

Required methods for absolute accuracy testing are located in Appendix B – Example RMSE Calculation for Vertical DTM &amp; Horizontal Planimetric Features.   For all Mapping Surveys the Department may collect Vertical Checkpoints for independent verification of the DTM accuracies anywhere within the project. If the Department finds any vertical discrepancies that exceed the maximum allowable RMSEZ, the Consultant will perform any corrective work necessary to meet this specification at no additional cost to the Department within a time frame agreed upon by the Department and the Consultant.
2008.2.1.1 DTM Vertical Accuracy Statement
Utilize this statement in any metadata/documentation/surveyor certification when referencing the accuracy of the dataset:  “This data set was tested to meet ASPRS Positional Accuracy Standards for Digital Geospatial Data (2014) for an Ohio Department of Transportation (Insert Vertical Accuracy Class Label) (US ft.) RMSEZ Vertical Accuracy Class. Actual NVA accuracy was found to be RMSEZ = ___ US ft., equating to +/- ___ US ft. at a 95% confidence level. Actual VVA accuracy was found to be +/- ___ US ft. at the 95th percentile.”  Calculation examples are in Appendix B – Example RMSE Calculation for Vertical DTM &amp; Horizontal Planimetric Features.
2008.2.2 Horizontal Planimetric Accuracy
This specification covers the collection of existing planimetric features and all known underground utilities. INS Based Mapping Survey products are included with this specification and may be required in the scope of services. Ensure positioning is performed relative to geodetic/primary project control.    Collect Planimetric Checkpoints along well-defined planimetric features shown in the delivered mapping.  Checkpoints collected for the vertical DTM accuracy test may be utilized if they are on a planimetric feature (for example: painted edge line). Checkpoints should be dispersed throughout the project and not located within 200 ft. of mapping control points.

<li>Well-Defined Points: Represent a feature for which the horizontal position is known to a high degree of accuracy and position with respect to the geodetic datum. For accuracy testing, well-defined points must be easily visible or recoverable on the ground, on the independent source of higher accuracy, and on the product itself.
To determine the minimum number of checkpoints, use the following formula:   Number of Planimetric Checkpoints = 20+2*x, where x is equal to the distance of the project in miles

If the Department finds any planimetric features that exceed the maximum allowable RMSER, the Consultant will perform any corrective work necessary to meet this specification at no additional cost to the Department within a time frame agreed upon by the Department and the Consultant.
2008.2.2.1 Horizontal Planimetric Accuracy Statement
Utilize this statement in any metadata/documentation/surveyor certification when referencing the horizontal accuracy of the dataset:  “This data set was tested to meet ASPRS Positional Accuracy Standards for Digital Geospatial Data (2014) for an Ohio Department of Transportation 0.21 (US ft.) RMSEX / RMSEY Horizontal Accuracy Class. Actual positional accuracy was found to be RMSEX = ___ (US ft.) and RMSEY = ___ (US ft.) which equates to Positional Horizontal Accuracy = +/- ___ US ft. at 95% confidence level.”  See Appendix B –Example RMSE Calculation for Vertical DTM &amp; Horizontal Planimetric Features for horizontal planimetric feature accuracy calculation procedure.
2008.2.3 Mapping Control
Collect coordinates and elevations at the center of the aerial target or selected picture point for photo control. All ground control (Targets and Picture Points) shall be furnished with a survey nail except on private property. Ensure all photo control is positioned relative to the Geodetic Control and/or Primary Project Control and meets the RMSE tolerances outlined in 2006.2.2.7 Coordinate Statistical Analysis. A professional surveyor licensed in the State of Ohio will document the accuracies, survey procedures and
Location &amp; Design Manual, Volume 4                    January 2025

methods used. Vertical control for debiasing point cloud data does not require a physical monument but should still be positioned following Section 2006.2 Control Surveys and tied to Geodetic and/or Project Control.  If a geodetic/primary control survey will not be performed, all aerial control horizontal surveys shall be referenced to and tied into the National Spatial Reference System (NSRS) as defined by the National Geodetic Survey (NGS) or through the project scoping process.
2008.2.3.1 UAS Specific Mapping Control
The total number of Ground Control Points (GCPs) shall be determined by the following formula:
Total GCPs = Area (in acres) x 0.2  There will be a minimum number of 5 GCP’s set for any project. GCPs shall be located to ensure an evenly distributed Triangular network exists throughout the entire project area. These points are used to control the products generated, not check the absolute accuracy of the deliverables.
2008.2.4 UAS Specific Data Collection (Flight Parameters)
For projects utilizing UAS, consult with the District Survey Operations Manager, or the Office of CADD and Mapping Services to determine equipment and collection that best meets project needs. It is generally recommended that UAS data collection for survey and mapping be limited to projects that are no larger than 50 acres or 1 mile in length.   Flights should be planned with FAA requirements, UAS Center’s policies and procedures, as well as ground sampling distance (GSD) condition requirements.
2008.3 Conventional Mapping Surveys
2008.3.1 Accuracies
All data collected via conventional technologies shall be collected using means and methods that meet the mapping accuracy requirements set forth within this section. Deliverables should be generated by directly observing/occupying Geodetic/Project Control as defined in Section 2006.2 Control Surveys.  Conventional mapping surveys do not require separate, independent ground control for controlling and verifying mapping accuracies (due to the ability of the equipment to directly observe or occupy project control). Using established workflows and surveying judgement, proper equipment must be utilized to achieve these accuracy thresholds as scoped for the project:
