SECTION 100 – GENERAL INFORMATION
101 0BINTRODUCTION
101.1 35B DM FORMAT C101.1
Where the BDM is written in two-column format, the left column represents ODOT structural design specifications and the right column represents commentary. The commentary may include background information; design guidance; or other supplemental information related to a corresponding specification item. Where the BDM is written in full page width format, all content represents ODOT structural design specifications. ODOT structural design specification items shall apply unless the Owner provides a waiver of the item in writing.
The design values, specifications, practices, etc. established in the BDM promote uniform, safe and sound designs for bridges and structures in the State of Ohio. During the normal staged review process, the Owner has the authority to require the Designer of Record to justify or otherwise seek recommendation from the Office of Structural Engineering (OSE) when deviation from the design values, specifications, practices, etc. is necessary.
101.2 36B DM AUDIENCE C101.2
The requirements of the two-column format ODOT Bridge Design Manual (BDM) are written to the “Designer of Record” as defined in BDM Section 101.4. The sentences that direct the Designer of Record to perform work are written as commands. For example, a requirement to design bridges for HL-93 loading would be expressed as, “Design all bridges for an HL-93 loading,” rather than “The Designer of Record shall design all bridges for an HL-93 loading.” In the imperative mood, the subject, “the Designer of Record” is understood.
All requirements to be performed by others have been written in the active voice. Sentences written in the active voice identify the party responsible for performing the action. For example, “The Office of Structural Engineering will review designs for non-standard bridge railings.”
Sentences that define terms; describe a product or desired result; or describe a condition that may exist are written in indicative mood. These types of sentences use verbs requiring no action. For example, “All reinforcing steel shall be epoxy coated.”
101.3 37BPURPOSE C101.3
The BDM establishes ODOT policy for the following:
A. The analysis, design and rating of new and existing bridges.
B. The analysis and design of new and existing retaining walls and noise walls.
C. The analysis and design of new and existing pedestrian structures.
BDM Section 100 – General Information 2020 Edition – January 2025
1-2
Consider the practicability of construction with reference to each detail of design.
Constructability is especially critical when new ideas are considered.

For structures on a horizontal curve, provide a Reference Line. Show the Reference Line on the General Plan/Site Plan view with the stations of the points where the Reference Line intersects the curve. Provide skews, dimensions of substructure elements and superstructure elements from this Reference Line, both on the General Plan /Site Plan and on the individual detail sheets. Do not providing dimensions from the curve. Dimension the distances between the curve and Reference Line at each substructure units.
The purpose for dimensioning the distance between the Reference Line and centerline of the substructure units is to make a check available to the contractor.
For each substructure unit, show the skew angle with respect to the centerline of construction or, for curved structures, to a Reference Line. Measure the skew angle from the centerline of construction or Reference Line to a line perpendicular to the centerline of the substructure unit or from a line perpendicular to the centerline of construction or Reference Line to the centerline of the substructure unit as shown in BDM Figure 102-1.
Figure 102-1
In placing dimensions on the drawings, provide sufficient overall dimensions so that it will not be necessary for a person reading the drawings to add up dimensions to determine the length, width or height of an abutment, pier or other element of a structure.
Do not show a detail or dimension in more than one place on the plans.
Unnecessary duplication increases the risk of errors, particularly where revisions are made at a later date.
If, because of lack of space on a particular sheet, it is necessary to place a view or a section on another sheet, provide cross references on both sheets.
Define all abbreviations in a legend provided on the General Notes sheet.
Plan sheets shall be 22-in x 34-in. Margins shall be 2-in on the left edge and 1/2-in on all other edges.

102.5 46BESTIMATED QUANTITIES C102.5
Provide plan quantities separately for each bridge SFN. Do not incorporate common bid items between multiple bridge structures in a project.
Summation of common items cannot be done due to computer tracking of quantities based on Structure File Number.
Furnish electronic files of the structure quantity calculations in accordance with the L&amp;D, Vol. 3. Prepare neat, accurate and complete quantity calculations on standard computation sheets. Arrange the calculations in an orderly fashion so that a person examining them will be able to follow the calculation sequence. Someone other than the original Designer shall independently check the calculations. The Designer and Checker shall each prepare separate sets of calculations to minimize risk of error. Reconcile the two sets of calculations and select one set (either the Designer&#39;s or the Checker&#39;s) as the official set. Both the Designer and Checker shall initial and date each sheet of the calculations. The results of this official set shall correspond to the quantities shown on the plans.
Since this information may be useful to contractors preparing bids, the Department provides it as a courtesy at the time of advertisement. This information is not considered part of the bidding documents and is for information only.
Provide the Bridge Number; SFN; the date; the individual Designer and Checker initials; and subject on each sheet of quantity calculations.
Sheets that are accidentally misplaced are sometimes very difficult to identify if they do not contain this information.
102.6 47BSTANDARD BRIDGE DRAWINGS C102.6
Where required by the Scope of Services and/or BDM, follow current Standard Bridge Drawings. Provide reference to Standard Bridge Drawings using the Drawing Number and latest date of revision or the approval date if there has been no revision. If standards are not adequate for a particular design, then modify the standards, as necessary, by supplying pertinent details, dimensions or material specifications in the plans.
Standard Bridge Drawings provide common details and requirements for structures in Ohio. Most of the drawings require fully detailing the items in the plans to provide clear and bid-worthy plans. The Designer shall be familiar with the standards and know if they are adequate for the particular design situation being addressed. Standard Bridge Drawings can be downloaded from ODOT’s Office of Structural Engineering website.
Reference Standard Bridge Drawings on the General Notes sheet and the project plan’s Title Sheet.
Do not reference a standard drawing if only one or two small details on the standard are applicable. In such instances, include the required details in the project plans. Do not reference more than one standard drawing for a individual bridge component.
Reference to a standard drawing when very little of the drawing applies to a project can be confusing and lead to contract disputes.
102.7 48BSUPPLEMENTAL SPECIFICATIONS
C102.7
Supplemental Specifications are specifications that supplement and supersede the C&amp;MS.
Supplemental Specifications are available on ODOT’s Division of Construction Management website.
Modifications to Supplemental Specifications require plan notes and “As Per Plan” pay items.

102.8 49BPROPOSAL NOTES C102.8
Proposal Notes are specifications that supplement and supersede Supplemental Specifications and the C&amp;MS.
The Department’s numbered Proposal Notes were developed to assure uniform specifications for specific items that may not be required on every project or are either experimental or of an interim status.
Proposal Notes are available on ODOT’s Division of Construction Management website.
Do not revise Proposal Notes.
Reference Proposal Notes in the table of Estimated Quantities by adding a note to the end of the applicable bid item (See Proposal Note).  Do not refer to Proposal Notes by number.
Ensure the Proposal Note is only specified where applicable.
102.9 50BSPECIAL PROVISIONS C102.9
Special Provisions are project specific specifications with the same order of precedence in the Contract as Proposal Notes. Provide the title and date for all Special Provisions on the Title Sheet of the Plans.
Consider converting General Notes that are lengthy such that multiple plan sheets would be required into Special Provisions.
102.10 51BSUPPLEMENTS C102.10
Supplements are individually numbered documents describing necessary information such as laboratory test methods and certification or pre-qualification procedures for materials.
Do not reference Supplements in the bridge plan General Notes or the project plan’s Title Sheet.
Where necessary, Supplements are referenced as needed by the C&amp;MS and Supplemental Specifications.
103 2B RIDGE PLAN SHEET ORDER C103
A set of completed bridge plans shall conform to the following order:
A.  Site Plan
B.  General Plan – A General Plan sheet is required for any of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bridges with variable width and/or curved alignment</li>
<li>Bridges with staged construction 3. Bridge deck overlay projects
The purpose of the General Plan sheet is to provide bridge information that can get lost in the clutter of information typically shown on a site plan. The General Plan sheet does not require an elevation view.
C. General Notes D.  Estimated Quantities
BDM Section 100 – General Information 2020 Edition – January 2025

E. Phase Construction Details F.  Abutments
G.  Piers H.  Superstructure
I.  Railing Details J.  Expansion device details
K.  Non-standard approach slab details L. Concrete Reinforcement Bar List
104 3BSTRUCTURAL REVIEWS C104
The purpose of a review for each of the Structure Submissions defined in BDM Section 200 is to ensure compliance with a project’s Scope of Services. If a Structure Submission is required by the Scope of Services, do not omit a compliance review of the submission from the Project Development Process.
Upon request of the Project Manager, the Design Agency shall provide project records including, but not limited to: design calculations, software files, survey data, and project correspondence, in a timely manner.
The Design Agency shall provide to the Project Manager, a written response for every review comment provided in a Structure Submission. The Project Manager will provide a copy of the written response to each compliance reviewer. The project shall not proceed to the next stage of the development process until the Project Manager is satisfied that all comments have been resolved. Resolution of a Structure Submission does not absolve the Designer of Record from liability for Errors or Omissions. Ultimately, the Designer of Record bears the responsibility for the content of the design plans.
Compliance with the Scope of Services means compliance with the following: all referenced contract documents; all defined aspects of the project; schedule; and budget. These reviews are not intended as a computational or analysis check of the contents of the design plans. However, the compliance reviewer may perform an independent analysis or request design calculations, software files or other project records, to verify that a design is compliant.
For ODOT-let projects, the performance of the structural reviews is the responsibility of the District Project Manager assigned to administer the project. The Project Manager may: delegate the review to a technical expert at the District; request review services from ODOT’s Central Office; or contract review services from a prequalified consulting firm.
The Department typically obligates at least a 30-day window from Stage Submittal to Stage Completion. Within that timeframe the Project Manager will transmit the submittal to various reviewers for comments to be addressed by the Design Agency and resolved to the Project Manager’s satisfaction. The Project Manager should be aware that resolution of review comments can delay a project’s Staged completion date.
An acceptable Design Agency written response to a structure review is: “We concur with all comments except the following:”

201.1 52BSTRUCTURE TYPE STUDY
201.1.1 168BGENERAL C201.1.1
Where a bridge is the most appropriate structure for a particular site, then perform the Structure Type Study to determine the appropriate bridge type.
Refer to BDM Section 101.7 for the definition of what qualifies as a bridge per the ORC. Study the project site in detail to determine the best structure alternative. Conducting a site visit is highly recommended. In many cases, it can be readily determined whether a bridge or culvert structure should be chosen for a particular site.
Provide a separate Structure Type Study for each SFN on a project. For identical parallel bridges that require separate SFN’s in accordance with the Ohio Bridge Inventory Coding Guide, develop a full Structure Type Study for one of the bridges. The Structure Type Study for the twin structure shall refer to the full type study to avoid duplication of effort.
The purpose for this requirement is to ensure that every bridge on a project receives an independent Structure Type Study. For bridges that do not require an SFN, a Structure Type Study is still required by the opening paragraph of BDM Section 201.1.1. At the approval of the Project Manager, an independent Type Study may be provided for the twin structure.
201.1.2 169BSUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS
A Structure Type Study submission shall include the following:
A.  Profile for each bridge alternative, see BDM Section 201.1.2.11
B.  Preliminary Structure Site Plan for preferred bridge alternative, see BDM Section 201.1.2.2
C.  Hydrology and Hydraulics (H&amp;H) Report, see L&amp;D, Vol. 2.
D.  Narrative of Bridge Alternatives see BDM Section 201.1.2.3.
E.  Cost Analysis see BDM Section 201.1.2.4. F.  Foundation Recommendation see BDM Section 0.
G.  Preliminary Maintenance of Traffic Plan, see BDM Section 201.1.2.6
Include the Structure Type Study in the review submission made directly to the District Office.
201.1.2.1 368BPROFILE FOR BRIDGE ALTERNATIVE
C201.1.2.1
Draw the profile for each bridge alternative being considered to the same scale as the corresponding plan.

A. Existing and proposed profile grade lines
B. Existing ground line  C. An outline of the structure
D. Bridges conveying riverine streams or channels require the following hydraulic information:</li>
<li>Cross-section of waterway channel  2. Highest known high-water mark</li>
<li>Normal water elevation
Refer to BDM Section 101.7 for Normal Water Elevation, OHWM and Thalweg definitions.
Normal Water Elevation is an estimate of where the water elevation will be when not influenced by surface water runoff.  Plan designer should establish the Normal Water Elevation from waterway physical characteristics and observed water elevations when surface runoff is minimal or not present.  No recurrence interval runoff event corresponds to the Normal Water Elevation.  The Normal Water Elevation will be lower than the OHWM elevation.
The Normal Water Elevation, shown in the bridge profile view, provides bidding contractors with understanding of the physical characteristics of a waterway and that water is likely present even when no surface water runoff is occurring.  Identification of the NWE, OHWM and design storm event water elevations provides information as to how the channel responds to varying occurrences of surface water runoff and can be critical in planning and bidding in stream work.</li>

Special Provisions are the method ODOT uses to attach the waterway permit conditions to the project construction plans. The waterway permits Special Provisions is prepared by the OES-WPU and may contain the following:
A2. All pertinent waterway permit conditions B2. Plan sheets and mapping approved by the regulatory
agencies.

C2. Impact quantities authorized in aquatic resources. D2. Section 404 Completion Certification form
201.3.2 172BTEMPORARY ACCESS FILLS C201.3.2
A Temporary Access Fill (TAF) is a fill or structure that allows a contractor access to work on roads or bridges located within bodies of water. Examples of TAF’s include cofferdams; temporary structures for maintaining traffic; causeways and workpads; and demolition debris. The placement of all TAF’s in “Waters of the United States” must be performed in accordance with the special provisions for waterway permits.
A contractor’s means and methods of construction will dictate the TAF required for a project. However, the Department must estimate the potential impacts to “Waters of the United States” during project development to enable all permits to be in-place during contract letting. For most projects, the waterway permits are in place prior to sale. There may be instances where unforeseen delays dictate that the waterway permits will not be acquired until after sale and/or award; however, the Department will still provide Waterway Permit Special Provisions prior to project sale indicating anticipated conditions and the pending permit authorizations. In those instances, it is imperative that the waterway permits be obtained prior to the contractor beginning any work within any Waters of the United States. Furthermore, it is incumbent upon the Department that these permits provide all bidding contractors the ability to construct the project without resulting in expensive delays, change orders or fines.
Use the following requirements to estimate the size of TAF’s:
A. The TAF shall provide access to all piers located within the OHWM of the waterway from at least one bank of the waterway.
The Department partnered with the Ohio Contractor’s Association to develop these requirements. This information is intended for permit application purposes only and should not be included in the project plan set. However, to assist the OES-WPU in the determination process, Designers should calculate worst case scenario TAF impacts, including linear footage from upstream to downstream and acreage, to submit in the Permit Determination Request to OES. An example Plan, Profile and Cross-section using the guidance provided above are shown in BDM Figure 201-1. These quantities should be provided to the DEC along with a completed copy of the checklist shown on the OES Waterway Permit Determination Request website. The minimum flow to be maintained during construction should be calculated according to BDM Section 201.3.2.F. Designers will need to estimate whether this flow can be maintained through conduits or if open channels will be required.
BDM Section 200 – General Information 2020 Edition – January 2025
2-17
In the case of staging, the permit application shall reflect the construction stage that impacts the largest area of the waterway.
Access may be provided by construction staging of the TAF. When considering the constructability of staged TAF’s, typical superstructure erection plans for lifting lengths of 50-ft or more require two cranes. Unless the access for member delivery is from an adjacent structure, the TAF must provide access to each end of the lift from one bank.
B. Locate the TAF directly beneath the superstructure. The surface width of the TAF shall be equal to the out-to-out width of the superstructure plus 50-ft outboard on one side of the structure and 20-ft outboard on the other side of the structure.
C. Extend the TAF at least 40-ft beyond the furthest pier accessed by the TAF.
D. The side slopes of the TAF shall be no steeper than 1.5:1 (H:V).
E. Locate the top surface of the TAF at least 1-ft above the OHWM.
F. Design the TAF to maintain the Standard Temporary Discharge (STD) as detailed in L&amp;D, Vol. 2, Section 1012.

Prepare a Design Exception in accordance with Section 105 of the L&amp;D, Vol. 1 when the “Actual Minimum” Vertical Clearance is less than the L&amp;D Manual minimum clearance.
The “Actual Minimum” Vertical Clearance is the theoretical overhead clearance provided by the design plans.
302.2 59B RIDGE WIDTH
Establish bridge superstructure widths in accordance with L&amp;D, Vol. 1, Section 302, unless specified in the Scope of Services.
302.3 60BLATERAL CLEARANCE C302.3
Provide divided highways having four or more lanes crossing under an intersecting highway with a minimum lateral clearance of 30-ft from the edge of traveled lane to the nearest obstruction.
Establish lateral clearances for other roadway classifications in accordance with L&amp;D, Vol. 1, unless specified in the Scope of Services.
An obstruction would be a traffic barrier, wall, column or a non-traversable slope. For a non-traversable 2:1 slope, measure the lateral clearance to the point where the 2:1 back slope intersects the radius at the toe of the 2:1 slope. Refer to L&amp;D, Vol. 1, Figure 307-2E for an illustration of safety grading for ditch sections.

302.4 61BINTERFERENCE DUE TO EXISTING SUBSTRUCTURE
C302.4
Do not locate a new substructure unit where an existing substructure or its foundation would interfere with the foundation or construction of the proposed substructure unit.
This applies particularly where piles are to be driven.  It is desirable to avoid the difficulty and expense of removing deep underground portions of the existing substructure and to avoid the resultant disturbance of the ground. Obstructions within the footprint of the new substructure shall be completely removed to avoid interference.
Where existing substructure units are shown on the Site Plan, place the locations precisely. Show the existing substructure configuration based on existing plans or field verified dimensions. Misrepresentation of the location of the existing substructure units has resulted in expensive change orders during construction.
Label existing dimensions as (+/-) plus or minus in the contract documents.
302.5 62B RIDGE STRUCTURE, SKEW, CURVATURE AND SUPERELEVATION
C302.5
During preliminary engineering, investigate alternatives that eliminate the presence of skew angles that exceed 30°, horizontal curves and superelevation transitions within the actual bridge limits.
Skews, curves and superelevation transitions add complexity which can increase costs and also result in poor ride quality.

303.1.3 176BLONGITUDINAL FORCES C303.1.3
Assume force effects transferred through bearings to the substructure occur at the bearing seat elevation.
<em>Bearings that permit rotation (e.g. elastomeric bearings, rocker bearings, etc.) will develop eccentricities resulting in applied moments as defined in LRFD 14.6.3.2. Typically, these eccentricities are negligible with respect to the design of the substructures that support the bearings and may be ignored.</em>
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-3
The total factored longitudinal loading applied to the substructure at each expansion bearing shall be the larger of:
A. The Frictional Force acting on the substructure if the bearing slides.
B. The bearing’s nominal (i.e. unfactored) resistance to longitudinal loading.
<em>A properly designed expansion bearing will utilize friction in lieu of mechanical anchorage to prevent the bearing from sliding under lateral loading. For these bearings, the maximum lateral loading on the substructure unit will be in the form of Friction, LRFD 3.13.</em>
For bearings that require mechanical anchorage, the bearing’s resistance to lateral loading represents the maximum lateral load on the substructure unit. Resistance in this instance is nominal because it is applied to the substructure as a loading.
303.1.4 177BSEISMIC C303.1.4
All bridges in the State of Ohio are located within Seismic Performance Zone 1.
Refer to BDM Section 305.1.5 for Seismic Geotechnical requirements.
This provision is based on Ohio’s seismologic data which is explained in BDM Section 305.1.5.
303.1.4.1 378BSEISMIC PERFORMANCE ZONE 1 C303.1.4.1
Seismic analysis is not required except as noted in BDM Sections 303.1.4.1.a and 303.1.4.1.b.
<em>Bridges designed according to the Strength and Service Limit States of the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications are assumed to have sufficient capacity to resist Seismic Performance Zone 1 design loads applied at the Extreme Limit State.</em>
<em>For bridges founded at locations with 0.10 ≤ SD1 &lt; 0.15, specify transverse reinforcement at the top and bottom of columns in accordance with LRFD 5.11.4.1.4 and 5.11.4.1.5.</em>
<em>BDM Figure 303-1 provides sample details for a cap and column pier that conform to the requirements of LRFD 5.11.4.1.4 and 5.11.4.1.5.</em>

<em>As a minimum, the overlapping distance of the superstructure and substructure bearing areas shall meet 100% of the minimal support length, N, calculated according to LRFD EQ. 4.7.4.4-1.

303.1.4.1.b 520BHORIZONTAL CONNECTION FORCE
C303.1.4.1.b
All structures shall have some mechanism to transfer horizontally applied superstructure loads (e.g. vehicular braking force, centrifugal force, vehicular collision force, friction load, water load, wind load, and wind load on live load) to the substructure to ensure structural stability. During a seismic event, design these mechanisms, that prevent the free horizontal translation of the superstructure in any direction relative to the substructure, to transfer an applied horizontal connection force at the Extreme Event I Limit State. Only provide additional restraint for seismic loads (e.g. seismic pedestals) where the mechanisms noted above do not provide sufficient capacity. Refer to BDM Section 303.1.4.1.c for bearing requirements.
Examples of mechanisms include fixed bearings, bearing guides, abutment diaphragms, diaphragm guides, wing walls and wind locks.
<em>The magnitude of the connection force shall be 0.15 or 0.25 times the tributary permanent load at the location of the restraint as determined in LRFD 3.10.9.2. If sufficient geotechnical information is not available to determine Site Class, assume the magnitude of the connection force is 0.25 times the tributary permanent load.</em>
The load factor for live load, γEQ, may be taken as 0.0.
The tributary permanent load defined in LRFD 3.10.9.2 represents the factored dead load of the superstructure applying load to the device or object providing the directional restraint. If every bearing supporting the superstructure provides transverse restraint, the tributary permanent load applied to each restraint would equal the factored dead load reaction at each bearing. If only one transverse restraint was provided at each substructure unit, the tributary permanent load applied to each restraint would equal the sum of the factored dead load reactions for each bearing at the substructure unit. If only one transverse restraint was provided for the entire superstructure unit, the tributary permanent load applied to the restraint would equal the sum of the factored dead load reactions of every bearing. Longitudinal restraint connection forces would be determined similarly.
<em>For restraint provided in multiple directions, LRFD 3.10.8 applies.</em>
Because a structure in Seismic Performance Zone 1 is assumed to be able to carry the loads within the elastic strength range of its members or is assumed to be properly detailed to prevent collapse beyond the elastic strength range of its members, analysis of the superstructure, substructure and foundation for the load effects resulting from the connection force is not required.
Provide cross-frames, designed to resist Strength and Service load combinations, to create a direct load path from the point of horizontal connection force application to the deck.
These cross-frame do not need to be designed for Extreme Event limit state loading.

<em>Evaluate the seismic vulnerability of an existing structure for rehabilitation projects requiring complete deck or superstructure replacements.

A. AS &gt; 0.05
B. SD1 &lt; 0.10
303.1.4.2.a 522BSUPERSTRUCTURE
<em>For projects where seismic vulnerability is evaluated, at bearing locations that will transmit the horizontal connection force from the substructure to the superstructure, provide cross-frames to resist Strength and Service load combinations to create a direct load path to the deck. For supports not in compliance with LRFD 4.7.4.4, provide seismic restrainers designed for the Horizontal Connection Force, specified in BDM Section 303.1.4.1.b.</em>
303.1.4.2.b 523BSUBSTRUCTURE C303.1.4.2.b
<em>For projects where seismic vulnerability is considered, concrete columns at piers that transfer the seismic horizontal connection force, according to BDM Section 303.1.4.1.b, shall meet the spiral and tie ductility requirements of LRFD Eq. 5.11.4.1.4-1 and LRFD 5.10.4. Do not use LRFD Eq. 5.6.4.6-1.</em>
Designers may consider releasing restraint provided by existing pier bearings as a viable seismic retrofit provided the abutments can accommodate the additional horizontal Strength and Service loadings. Otherwise, provide the required confinement of the primary steel in the axially loaded substructure members.
<em>LRFD Eq. 5.6.4.6-1 provides erroneous results based on the ratio of Ag/Ac. As the concrete cover increases, impractical areas of transverse reinforcement are required. LRFD Eq. 5.11.4.1.4-1 provides the volumetric reinforcement requirements for confinement of primary steel at locations where plastic hinges are formed during seismic events.</em>
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025

One acceptable method to increase the amount of confinement provided in an existing concrete column is through the use of Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) wrap systems.
<em>For bridges located in regions with an acceleration coefficient, SD1 &lt; 0.10, specify a confining stress due to FRP jacket (f1) of 0.150-ksi for the entire height of the column from the top of the footing/drilled shaft to the bottom of the cap. For bridges located in regions with an acceleration coefficient, SD1 ≥ 0.10, specify a confining stress due to FRP jacket (f1) of 0.300-ksi in the plastic hinge regions as defined in LRFD 5.11.4.1.5 and 0.150-ksi in the remaining portions of the columns. The plans shall include an elevation view of the columns with these confining stress regions clearly defined.</em>
<em>These systems are a viable alternative for dry columns supported on pile caps, spread footings and drilled shafts. Research has shown that providing a confining stress of 0.300-ksi in regions where plastic hinges may form at the top and bottom of columns as defined in LRFD 5.11.4.1.5 and providing a confining stress of 0.150-ksi outside of the plastic hinge regions is sufficient to prevent buckling of the longitudinal reinforcement.</em>

B.  Superstructure Concrete (Class QC2)........... 4.5-ksi C.  Drilled Shaft Concrete (Class QC5) ............. 4.0-ksi
The concrete used for drilled shafts is a 4.5-ksi mix design. However, since there is the potential for issues that cause a reduction in strength to arise during placement, a 500-psi reduction in the concrete strength shall be considered for design purposes.

C304.2.2
The following ODOT concrete types are available for substructure concrete sold under Item 511:
A1.  Class QC1 Concrete  B1.  Class QC1 Concrete with QC/QA
C1. Class QC3 Special Concrete D1. Class QC4 Mass Concrete
ODOT also has classes of concrete available for moderate setting (Class QC MS) and fast setting (Class QC FS) mixes which are primarily used in pavement applications. For projects where these mix designs may be necessary, use an Item 511 CONCRETE, MISC. pay item and provide a plan note to clarify the project requirements.
The following ODOT concrete types are available for superstructure concrete sold under Item 511:

Specify Class QC4 Mass Concrete when the minimum dimension for a concrete component is 5-ft or greater or the diameter of a drilled shaft is 7-ft or greater.
304.2.3 180BCONSTRUCTION JOINTS C304.2.3
Show all Construction Joint locations in the plans. Label joints as:
A1. Construction Joint B1. Optional Construction Joint
C1. Construction Joint, Roughened D1. Optional Construction Joint, Roughened
<em>Each plan specified Construction Joint location shall meet the Interface Shear Transfer – Shear Friction requirements specified in LRFD 5.7.4.</em>
A Construction Joint is a plane separating concrete placements that reach initial set at different times. An Optional Construction Joint is one that is placed at the Contractor’s discretion. A Construction Joint, Roughened, is one with a finished surface that is intentionally roughened to an amplitude of 0.25-in.
C&amp;MS 511.09 defines the following Construction Joint surface finishes:
A1. Non-finished 1. Applies to horizontal surfaces or any other
orientation that does not require forming.
<em>2. For design purposes, the non-finished surface represents concrete placed against a clean concrete surface, free of laitance, but not intentionally roughened as defined in LRFD 5.7.4.4.</em>
B1. Form-finished 1. Applies to vertical surfaces or any other
orientation that requires forming. This finish also applies to the Construction Joint created when placing concrete against an existing concrete surface, placed in a previous project unless otherwise specified in the Plans.
<em>2. For design purposes, the form-finished surface represents concrete placed against a clean concrete surface, free of laitance, but not intentionally roughened as defined in LRFD 5.7.4.4.</em>
C1. Roughened 1. C&amp;MS 511.09.A defines the acceptable
roughened surface finish for plastic concrete and C&amp;MS 511.09.B defines the acceptable roughened surface finish for hardened concrete.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-12
<em>2. For design purposes, both C&amp;MS 511.09 roughened surfaces represent concrete placed against a clean concrete surface, free of laitance, with surface intentionally roughened to an amplitude of 0.25-in as defined in LRFD 5.7.4.4.</em>
<em>3. C&amp;MS 515.15 defines the acceptable surface finish for composite prestressed beams. For design purposes, the C&amp;MS 515.15 composite surface finish represents a cast-in-place concrete slab on clean concrete girder surfaces, free of laitance with surface roughened to an amplitude of 0.25-in as defined in LRFD 5.7.4.4.</em>
Joints labeled in the plan as “Construction Joint” or “Optional Construction Joint” will receive a non-finished or form-finished surface depending upon orientation.
Construction Joints may be necessary to facilitate construction; however, joints represent a potential plane of weakness in a concrete member. The best approach to locating joints is to minimize the number and, if possible, locate joints at areas of minimum stress. The recommended design approach to Construction Joints should be as follows:
A2. For horizontal Construction Joints or any other orientation that does not require forming, design the joints using the following 4-step sequence:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Determine if the interface shear capacity of a non-finished surface is sufficient for the specified joint location using the reinforcement and cross-section sized for shear and moment in the member.</li>
<li>If additional interface shear capacity is required and the location of the joint cannot be moved to an area of lower stress, reconsider the interface shear capacity with a roughened finish.</li>
<li>If additional interface shear capacity is still required, increase the interface shear reinforcement (Avf) crossing the shear plane and reconsider the interface shear capacity with a roughened finish.</li>
<li>If interface shear capacity is still not met, a redesign of the cross-section is warranted.
The surface treatment specified for Horizontal Construction Joints in the most recent revision dates of the Standard Bridge Drawings may be used without further analysis of the interface shear capacity.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-13
C2. For Construction Joints created when joining new concrete to concrete placed in a previous project, and the:</li>
<li>Existing concrete surface was formed, troweled, or saw cut, design the joints using the following 3-step sequence:
a. Determine if the interface shear capacity of a non-roughened surface is sufficient using non-shrink, non-metallic grout to anchor interface shear reinforcement in accordance with C&amp;MS 510.
b. If additional interface shear capacity is required specify the existing concrete surface to be intentionally roughened according to C&amp;MS 511.09.B.
c. If interface shear capacity is still not met, a redesign of the cross-section is warranted.</li>
<li>Existing concrete surface was prepared with chipping hammers, design the joints using the following 3-step sequence:
a. Determine if the interface shear capacity of a roughened surface is sufficient utilizing salvaged reinforcement across the shear plane.
b. If additional interface shear capacity is required, specify additional non-shrink, non-metallic grout to anchor interface shear reinforcement in accordance with C&amp;MS 510.
c. If interface shear capacity is still not met, a redesign of the cross-section is warranted.
When determining the area of concrete considered to be engaged in interface shear transfer (Acv), do not include the surface area of sawcut surfaces in the calculation of intentionally roughened surface area.
Where practical, avoid horizontal Construction Joints in piers, abutments, and retaining walls. Otherwise locate horizontal joints 1-ft above the OHWM.
If Keyways are specified in Construction Joints, provide a cross-sectional view of the concrete member to completely define all Keyway dimensions.
Determine the factored shear resistance (Vr) of the Keyway as the least of the following:
A Keyway is a Construction Joint requiring formwork to create a “tongue and groove” geometry between the different concrete placements.
Keyways are not an effective mitigation method for water infiltration.
A2. Factored bearing capacity on the shear key mating surfaces due to shear loading
B2. Factored shear capacity on the dimension of shear key parallel to the shear loading
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-14
C2. Shear load inducing the Cracking Moment (Mcr) of the shear key due to the eccentricity of the shear loading located at the centroid of the shear key mating surfaces.
If the factored shear resistance of the Keyway (Vr) is less than the factored interface shear resistance across the depth of the keyless Construction Joint (Vri), then the contribution of the Keyway shall be ignored.
Specify Keyways in unreinforced Construction Joints and joints that serve the purpose of Contraction Joints.
Locate the Construction Joint at the base of columns supported directly on drilled shafts in accordance with BDM Section 305.4.4.
Provide Optional Construction Joints to avoid pier lift heights exceeding 30-ft. Detail reinforcement to be developed each side of the Optional Construction Joint.
Consider the use of Construction Joints for the following issues:
A3. To avoid or minimize member dimensions defined in BDM Section 304.2.2 that require Mass Concrete provisions.
B3. To accommodate standard concrete formwork construction practices and concrete member geometry changes. For example, Construction Joints may allow a Contractor to utilize a prior concrete placement for formwork support to complete a substructure unit.
C3. To accommodate construction sequencing. For example, a Construction Joint in a T-type pier stem may allow the removal of cofferdam sheeting which would otherwise be obstructed by pier cap concrete placed directly above.
Seal all Construction Joints in contact with fill above the footings and below the approach slab on the back of abutments, wingwalls and retaining walls with ITEM 512, TYPE 2 WATERPROOFING, 3-ft wide centered on the joint.
304.3 68BCONCRETE, PRESTRESSED C304.3

Select a compressive strength at the time of release ranging from 4.0-ksi to 5.0-ksi.  Provide the release strength in the contract plan General Notes.
In order to specify a release or 28-day concrete strength that deviates from the ranges provided, contact the Ohio Prestressers Association and/or the PCI Central Region to request documentation that the deviation is acceptable and can be produced within the project timeframe by at least two independent producers prequalified under S1079. ODOT may request verification of this documentation during project reviews.
Cast-in-place concrete used in prestressed concrete superstructures (composite decks, pier diaphragms, intermediate diaphragms, etc.) shall be Class QC2 or Class QC2 with QC/QA.

304.4 69BCONCRETE REINFORCEMENT
304.4.1 181BMATERIAL TYPES
The Department will allow six types of material for use as concrete reinforcement:
A. Uncoated Steel Reinforcement (USR)
B. Epoxy Coated Steel Reinforcement (ECSR) C. Galvanized Steel Reinforcement (GSR)
D. Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer Reinforcement (GFRP)
E. Chromium Steel Reinforcement (CSR)
F. Stainless Steel Reinforcement (SSR) Acceptable designs for each of these materials will yield differing results for reinforcement ratio and/or development lengths. Except as noted in C&amp;MS 709.16, the Department will require a Value Engineering Change Proposal according to C&amp;MS 105.19 in order to consider substitution of concrete reinforcement types after the Contract sale date.
The concrete reinforcement material type for new concrete members shall be defined in the Scope of Services. If the Scope of Services does not define the concrete reinforcement material type, then all reinforcement shall be ECSR according to BDM Section 304.4.1.2.
304.4.1.1 380BUNCOATED STEEL REINFORCEMENT
C304.4.1.1
Uncoated Steel Reinforcement is available for use only in rehabilitation of existing concrete members.
The Department will pay for USR as: ITEM 509 – UNCOATED STEEL REINFORCEMENT
USR is intended for applications where the work consists of repair or rehabilitation of existing concrete members reinforced with uncoated reinforcement. USR may also be considered for replacement of damaged reinforcement after surface preparation for overlays involving hydro demolition or scarification.  USR should also be considered for structural doweling applications into existing concrete according to C&amp;MS 510.
304.4.1.2 381BEPOXY COATED STEEL REINFORCEMENT
C304.4.1.2
Epoxy coated steel reinforcement shall be Grade 60, Fy = 60-ksi in accordance with C&amp;MS 709.00 furnished from a Supplement 1068 certified supplier.
Provide epoxy coated steel reinforcement except as noted in BDM Section 405.2 or unless otherwise noted in the Scope of Services.
The advantages of ECSR include:
A1. Provides increased corrosion protection above ordinary uncoated steel reinforcement.
B1. Lowest cost corrosion protection for steel reinforcement
C1. Shortest lead times for concrete reinforcement delivery
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-16
The Department will pay for ECSR as: ITEM 509 – EPOXY COATED STEEL REINFORCEMENT
D1. Permits field fabrication (e.g. bending and cutting) E1. Damage to the coating is repairable
F1. Readily available mechanical splice options  The disadvantages of ECSR include:
A2. Susceptible to coating damage during shipping, handling, installation and concrete placement.
B2. Unrepaired damage to the epoxy coating may result in corrosion similar to or in some cases worse than uncoated steel.
C2. Concrete bond strength to ECSR results in longer development lengths and potentially wider crack widths when compared to ordinary uncoated reinforcing steel.
D2. ECSR coating will degrade with extended exposure to UV light reducing the coating thickness and causing embrittlement.
E2. ECSR coating may be completely removed if exposed to the hydro-demolition surface preparation for deck overlays.
304.4.1.3 382BGALVANIZED STEEL REINFORCEMENT
C304.4.1.3
Galvanized steel reinforcement shall be Grade 60, Fy = 60-ksi in accordance with C&amp;MS 709.16 furnished from a Supplement 1068 certified supplier.
The Department will pay for GSR as ITEM 509 – GALVANIZED STEEL REINFORCEMENT.
Two types of galvanized coating systems are available: ASTM A767 and ASTM A1094.
ASTM A767 reinforcement is normal uncoated reinforcement that is fabricated then sent to a hot-dip galvanizer for coating.
ASTM A1094 reinforcement is coated in a continuous galvanizing process before it is sent to the bar fabricator for cutting and bending. This process saves time and freight by eliminating the trip to the galvanizer after fabrication. The fabricator is responsible for repairing the coating on ends of bars cut during the fabrication process.
The advantages of GSR include:
A1. Unlike ECSR, unrepaired damage to GSR bars that occurs during shipping, handling, installation, or concrete placement will be protected by galvanic corrosion.
B1. Structural development lengths are equal to ordinary uncoated steel reinforcement and shorter than ECSR.
C1. The introduction of the continuously galvanized reinforcement has enabled GSR to be more cost competitive with ECSR.
D1. Permits field fabrication (e.g. bending and cutting)
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-17
The disadvantages of GSR include:
A2. Corrosion will occur on improperly coated ends of continuously galvanized reinforcement damaged during fabrication.
B2. GSR lead times for delivery longer than ECSR. For hot dipped GSR, fabricated reinforcement needs to be shipped to galvanizer for coating.  For continuously GSR, prefabricated reinforcement needs to ship from sole supplier in Oklahoma.
C2. Initial cost of GSR higher than ECSR. D2. The galvanized coating may be completely
removed if exposed to the hydro-demolition surface preparation for deck overlays.
E2. The minimum bend diameters for ASTM A767 bars are larger than ASTM A1094, USR, ECSR, CSR and SSR.
304.4.1.4 383BGFRP REINFORCEMENT C304.4.1.4
GFRP reinforcement shall be in accordance with C&amp;MS 705.28 furnished from a Supplement 1138 certified supplier.
GFRP reinforcement shall only be utilized for the following applications:
The advantages of GFRP reinforcement include:
A1. GFRP reinforcement is much lighter than steel reinforcement resulting in lower shipping, handling, and installation costs.
A. Reinforcement in concrete decks for Beam-Slab bridges
B. Longitudinal reinforcement in concrete bridge railings
C. Spiral and tie reinforcement in axial compression members
D. Reinforcement in approach slabs
B1. Deterioration of GFRP reinforcement is negligible over the life of the structure.
C1. GFRP reinforcement is very cost competitive to ECSR.
The Department will pay for GFRP reinforcement as: ITEM 509 - NO. __ DEFORMED GFRP REINFORCEMENT.
The Department will not permit concrete removal using hydrodemoltion for any Corrective Work Plans involving new concrete members reinforced with GFRP reinforcement.
The disadvantages of GFRP reinforcement include:
A2. GFRP reinforcement does not have a well-defined yield point. This lack of ductility precludes its use as primary tension reinforcement in many applications
.B2. GFRP reinforcement has more limited availability for bent shapes compared to other material types. Bent bars for sizes #9 and #10 are not available. Also, vertical reinforcement in standard concrete bridge railing includes bend diameters smaller than permitted for GFRP reinforcement and bar shapes not available in GFRP reinforcement.
C2. An approved mechanical splice attached directly to GFRP reinforcement is not available. Mechanical splices to steel reinforcement then lapped to GFRP reinforcement provides an acceptable alternative.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-18
D2. Concrete repair work (e.g. hydro-demolition and chipping hammers) can irreparably damage GFRP reinforcement. ODOT has performed an acceptable hydro-demolition surface preparation on concrete reinforced with GFRP, but some damage to the reinforcement is likely. Test sections are necessary to determine machine settings for optimal results.
E2. GFRP reinforcement will deform more due to its lower elastic modulus than steel reinforcement.
F2. Does not permit field fabrication (e.g. bending and cutting)
304.4.1.5 384BCHROMIUM STEEL REINFORCEMENT
C304.4.1.5
Chromium steel reinforcement is available in three alloy types distinguished by their chromium content:
A. Type CL (2 - 3.9% Cr)
B. Type CM (4 – 7.9% Cr) C. Type CS (8 – 10.9% Cr) CSR shall be Grade 100, Fy = 100-ksi in accordance with C&amp;MS 709.17 furnished from a Supplement 1068 certified supplier. Specify the Type and Grade in the Plans. Do not use CSR Grade 120.
The Department will pay for CSR as: ITEM 509 – CHROMIUM STEEL REINFORCEMENT, TYPE
Chromium steel reinforcement offers a higher level of protection against corrosion than ordinary uncoated steel reinforcement due to its chemical composition. A measure of corrosion resistance available for steel reinforcement is the quantity of chloride in concrete that initiates corrosion commonly referred to as the chloride threshold (CT). Literature for chromium steel reinforcement suggests that Type CL has a CT 1.5 times greater than ordinary uncoated steel reinforcement; Type CM has a CT 2.0 times greater; and Type CS has a CT 4.0 times greater.
C&amp;MS 709.17 specifies Type CS if not otherwise specified in the Plans.
The advantages of CSR include:
A1. CSR provides three different levels of corrosion protection that exceed the corrosion resistance of ordinary uncoated steel reinforcement.  Type CL provides slightly less protection than undamaged ECSR while Type CM provides slightly more protection.
B1. CSR’s higher strength can be utilized to reduce congestion and development lengths of ordinary reinforcement. CSR is available in Grade 120, Fy = 120-ksi, but AASHTO does not permit steel reinforcement above 100-ksi.
C1. The bars have no coating that can be damaged during shipping, handling, installation, concrete placement, hand chipping and hydro-demolition.
D1. Permits field fabrication (e.g. bending and cutting)
The disadvantages of CSR include: A2. CSR has a higher unit cost than ECSR. The cost of
CSR increases with increases in chromium content. Type CL having the lowest cost and Type CS the highest cost.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-19
B2. CSR is not produced locally so availability could be an issue and lead times would be longer than ECSR.
304.4.1.6 385BSTAINLESS STEEL REINFORCEMENT
C304.4.1.6
Stainless steel reinforcement shall be Grade 75, Fy = 75-ksi in accordance with C&amp;MS 709.18 furnished from a Supplement 1068 certified supplier.
The Department will pay for SSR as: ITEM 509 – STAINLESS STEEL REINFORCEMENT.
SSR reinforcement weighs slightly less than ordinary steel reinforcement. Refer to ASTM A955 Table 1 for more information.
The advantages of SSR include:
A1. SSR offers the highest level of corrosion protection for concrete reinforcement available. The bars have no coating that can be damaged during shipping, handling, installation, concrete placement, hand chipping, and hydro-demolition.
B1. Structural development lengths are equal to ordinary uncoated steel reinforcement and shorter than ECSR.
C1. Permits field fabrication (e.g. bending and cutting)
The disadvantages of SSR include:
A2. AASHTO will not permit the use of SSR above Seismic Zone 1 or in areas where plastic hinging is expected.
B2. Equipment used to handle and fabricate stainless steel needs to be kept separate from that used to fabricate carbon steel reinforcement.
C2. SSR availability could be an issue and lead times would be longer than ECSR.
D2. Requires stainless steel or plastic ties. E2. SSR has the highest initial cost for the
reinforcement types listed in BDM Section 304.4.1
304.4.2 182BMAXIMUM LENGTH C304.4.2
The maximum length of fabricated concrete reinforcement shall not exceed 60-ft.
The practical maximum length of concrete reinforcement is 40-ft.  This limit is for both transit purposes and construction convenience. To facilitate an economical design using 60-ft bar stock, where multiple sets of lapped bars are required (e.g. longitudinal slab reinforcement) consideration should be given to using multiple sets of 30-ft long bars.
For bent or radial bars, the maximum dimension from a straight line between the ends of the bar and the apex of the bar shall not exceed 7.5-ft, See BDM Figure 304-1.

304.4.5 185BMECHANICAL SPLICES C304.4.5
Mechanical splices are an acceptable alternative to lap splices. Mechanical splices shall be in accordance with the requirements of C&amp;MS 509.
When mechanical splices are required, designate which bar(s) will have mechanical splice(s) in the bar list.
<em>When specifying mechanical splices in congested areas, consider staggering splice locations in order to meet the minimum spacing of concrete reinforcement according to LRFD 5.10.3.1.</em>
Specify only mechanical type splices for bar sizes #14 and larger. The Department will not permit lap splices for these bar sizes.

305 12BFOUNDATIONS
305.1 71BGENERAL DISCUSSION C305.1
<em>Analyze all structure foundations for external stability in the Strength Limit State and for vertical and horizontal movements in the Service Limit State according to LRFD Section 10 or 11, as applicable.</em>
Meet all the subsurface exploration requirements for structures according to Section 300 of the SGE.
For footings supported on deep foundations, neglect bearing resistance of the footing concrete on soil.
External stability analyses include: bearing resistance; eccentric load limitations; overturning analyses; sliding resistance; and overall stability.
305.1.1 194BOVERALL STABILITY C305.1.1
<em>Analyze overall (global) stability for each structure at critical locations according to LRFD 10.5.5.2.1 and 11.6.3.7, with the following exceptions:</em>
Factored loads are incompatible with limit equilibrium analysis.
A. Do not use factored loads for the analyses B. Use the following resistance factors for the analyses:
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-30
Design all bridge substructure units and tiered retaining wall systems for overall stability using a resistance factor of φ = 0.65.
Design all other retaining walls for overall stability using a resistance factor of φ = 0.75.
Resistance factors as shown in LRFD 11.6.2.3 should be taken as the inverse of the following factors of safety (FS) for the case of limit equilibrium slope stability analysis only:
A. φ = 0.75 corresponds to FS = 1.3 B. φ = 0.65 corresponds to FS = 1.5
305.1.2 195BLATERAL LOADING ON DEEP FOUNDATIONS
C305.1.2
Perform a p-y analysis when analyzing deep foundations (such as driven piles, drilled shafts, micropiles, or continuous flight auger piles) under lateral loading.
A p-y analysis should be performed using a derivative of the COM624P program (e.g. LPILE). The p-y analysis provides the expected lateral displacement, as well as shear and moment load effects in the deep foundation element due to applied lateral loading, moment, and displacement.
<em>For abutments supported on MSE walls that utilize MSE reinforcements attached to the back of the abutment footing to resist lateral loading, the p-y analysis is not necessary.</em>
<em>For footings with battered piles designed to resist the for lateral loads, the p-y analysis is not necessary. See BDM Section 305.3.5.8 regarding the use of battered piles.</em>
For stub abutment walls of 10-ft or less in height, no p-y analysis is necessary as long as there is no scour extending below the bottom of footing, since the lateral load will not be enough to substantially effect the piles.
If a p-y analysis of the piles in the construction condition (without the superstructure installed) shows excessive stresses or deflection in the piles, provide plan notes regarding sequence of construction and limiting the placement of backfill behind the abutments before placement of the superstructure. For rehabilitation of existing full-height integral superstructures, provide plan notes to require excavation of the backfill prior to removal of the superstructure.
In the case of full-height integral abutments, the critical state will occur when there is earth pressure on the back of the abutment prior to having the superstructure in place to act as a lateral brace. C&amp;MS 516.07 will allow backfilling to the level of the beam seat prior to the completion of bearings connections. For integral construction, the superstructure will not act as a brace until the end diaphragms are complete. Designers should verify that the deep foundation elements have the capacity to resist this loading condition.
<em>For all integral abutments in the in-service condition (with the superstructure installed), if the piles have the minimum length specified in ICD-1-20 or ICD-2-18, no p-y analysis is necessary. Otherwise, perform p-y analyses combining the thermal deflection of the superstructure with the lateral earth and surcharge loads to check if the piles will experience excessive stresses.</em>
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-31
For deep foundation elements spaced closer than 5 diameters center to center, include group effects. Apply group effects only within the soil overburden length of the deep foundation. Do not apply to rock sockets.
Group effects for a single row of deep foundation elements under lateral loads (with the load oriented perpendicular to the axis of the row) can be ignored when the deep foundation elements are placed at a center-to-center spacing of 3.75 diameters or greater. For deep foundation elements spaced closer together, utilize a reduction factor as calculated in the following equation, per “Analysis and Design of Shallow and Deep Foundations” (Reese, Isenhower, and Wang, 2006):
Pm = 0.64 (S/B)0.34 for 1.0 ≤ S/B ≤ 3.75
Where:
Pm = p-multiplier S = center-to-center spacing of deep foundation
elements
<em>B = diameter of deep foundation element For multiple rows of deep foundation elements, see LRFD 10.7.2.4 for values of Pm. See FHWA GEC 10, Section 11.5.1, Table 11-1 regarding p-multipliers with a more comprehensive table of values for drilled shafts; use these same Pm for other drilled deep foundation elements (CFA piles or micropiles).</em>
When lateral loads are controlling the design of drilled shafts, perform lateral load testing according to the Scope of Services.
Consult the Office of Geotechnical Engineering regarding specifications for lateral load testing in the Scope of Services.
To evaluate lateral deflection in the Strength Limit State (overturning resistance) see BDM Section 307.1.4. Do not analyze deep foundations with the “Geotechnical Strength Limit State” analysis, per publication FHWA-NHI-10-016, Geotechnical Engineering Circular 10 (GEC 10) “Drilled Shafts: Construction Procedures and LRFD Design Methods,” Section 12.3.3.3.1.
To evaluate lateral deflection in the Service Limit State, see BDM Section 305.1.3.
The “Geotechnical Strength Limit State” analysis is over-conservative for consideration of overturning stability of deep foundations.

<em>In addition to the requirements for serviceability provided in LRFD C10.5.2.2, use the following criteria to establish acceptable settlement criteria:</em>
Consider the following methods for remediation to limit structural deformations due to settlement: increasing the foundation dimensions, excavating and replacing the foundation soils, adjusting the construction sequence, specifying waiting periods, application of surcharge loads, the use of deep foundations, or ground improvement. Wick drains or other subsurface drainage may be utilized to accelerate the rate of settlement. Select the method for settlement remediation based on the type of structure and time, space, and cost considerations. Refer to BDM Section 600 for applicable plan notes. A Special Provision for Installation of Wick Drains is available from the Office of Geotechnical Engineering.
A. The angular rotation caused by differential settlement between adjacent substructures shall not exceed 0.004 radians.
B. The maximum differential settlement (Δ) between adjacent substructures supporting continuous steel superstructures shall be:
∆= 0.55 𝐿𝐿 𝑆𝑆� − 2.6 &lt; 8.0

305.1.4 197BGROUND IMPROVEMENTS C305.1.4
If analyses demonstrate inadequate foundation stability (bearing, sliding, or lateral resistance; overall stability; or settlement) consider using ground improvement techniques to improve the foundation soils. Refer to the Transportation Research Board SHRP2 Geotech Tools website at <a href="http://www.geotechtools.org/">http://www.geotechtools.org/</a> for a comprehensive list of ground improvement techniques. Refer to FHWA-NHI-16-027/FHWA-NHI-16-028, Geotechnical Engineering Circular 13 (GEC 13) “Ground Modification Methods Reference Manual” for guidance on design for ground improvement techniques. Consider ground improvements for resistance of horizontal forces for structures with shallow foundations only after the improvements recommended in BDM Section 305.2.1.3 or BDM Section 307.1.3 are found to be not cost effective. Consult with the Office of Geotechnical Engineering if considering ground improvement techniques.

305.2.1 201BGENERAL DISCUSSION C305.2.1
<em>Design spread footings for piers in accordance with LRFD Section 10. Design spread footings for abutments and retaining walls in accordance with LRFD Section 11. Optimize spread footing dimensions for the controlling Limit State.</em>
The use of spread footings should be based on the following: depth and strength of suitable bearing materials; ease of construction; potential effects of phased construction; effects of flooding and scour; liquefaction and swelling potential of the soils; frost depth; and amount of predicted settlement versus tolerable structure movement. If placing spread footings on soil, consider the effects of primary and secondary settlements on long-term maintenance costs of the structure and appurtenances and the effects on ride quality.
Refer to BDM Section 201.2.1.3 for information to include in the Structure Foundation Exploration Report.
<em>LRFD Equation 10.6.3.1.2a-1 clarification of γq and γf is no longer necessary. This change is incorporated in the LRFD Bridge Design Specifications, 9th Edition (2020).</em>
<em>For the calculation of the depth correction factor dq used in LRFD Equation 10.6.3.1.2a-3, use the following equation:</em>
dq = 1 + 2 tan φf (1-sin φf)2 arctan (Df /B)
Where:
dq = depth correction factor (dim)
φf = angle of internal friction of soil (deg.)
<em>Df = footing embedment depth (ft) B = footing width (ft)</em>
arctan (Df/B) is in radians.
<em>Use this equation without any limits on the values of φf, Df, B, or Df /B, regardless of the limits imposed in LRFD 10.6.3.1.2a.</em>
The equation is per “A Revised and Extended Formula for Bearing Capacity” (Hansen, 1970).
<em>For the case of vertical or inclined eccentric loading, assume the values of ic = iq = iγ = 1.00. For the case of inclined centric loading, use LRFD Equations 10.6.3.1.2a-5 through 10.6.3.1.2a-9 for the calculation of ic, iq, and iγ.</em>
Do not use spread footing supported structures on MSE walls.
Spread footings are susceptible to loss of bearing caused by erosion during the service life of the structure.
305.2.1.1 386BSETTLEMENT C305.2.1.1
<em>For all spread footings, perform a settlement analysis according to LRFD 10.6.2.4. See BDM Section 305.1.3 for limits on vertical movement with respect to a supported bridge structure.</em>

Where significant settlement of a spread footing is predicted that would affect the serviceability of the supported structure, provide elevation reference monuments. See BDM Section 600 for notes and additional guidance.
Significant settlement is defined as that exceeding the serviceability limits in BDM Sections 305.1.3 or 307.1.6. Elevation reference monuments are for the purpose of measuring footing elevations during and after construction to document the performance of the spread footings, both short term and long term.

Where RQD = 0, Block Size Parameter Kb = RQD/Jn = 0, and subsequently Erodibility Index K = 0. In the scour calculations that depend on K, it is in the denominator, and K = 0 will result in a divide by zero error.
b. For the Intact Rock Mass Strength Parameter, Ms, use the following equations:
i. Ms = Qu for Qu ≥ 10-MPa, or
ii. Ms = (0.78) Qu 1.05 for Qu &lt; 10-MPa, where
iii. Qu is in units of MPa, per USBR publication &#34;Best Practices in Dam and Levee Safety Risk Analysis,&#34; Chapter IV-1.

C. Except as noted in BDM Section 305.2.1.2.b.(A), locate the bottom of footings founded on non-scour resistant rock at least one foot below the rock scour depth as calculated according to HEC 18. If historical evidence of scour deeper than the calculated depth in the rock foundation material at or near the footing location is available, spread footings foundations shall not be used.
D. Except as noted in BDM Section 305.2.1.2.b.(A), footings founded on soil are prohibited. For substructures founded on deep foundations not socketed into bedrock, extend the piles or drilled shafts to at least 15-ft below either the Thalweg elevation or the maximum estimated scour depth, whichever is deeper. For drilled shafts socketed into bedrock, see BDM Section 305.4.1.1.
E. At the design flood scour condition, evaluate the foundations at the Strength I Limit State for structural strength and external stability.

The following requirements apply to spread footings located inside of the plan view limits of the 500-yr flood plain:
A. At the check flood, evaluate the foundations at the Extreme Event II Limit State for structural strength and external stability.
B. Include live loads on the structure and foundations (LL and LS), and water load from stream pressure (WA).

305.2.1.3 388BRESISTANCE TO HORIZONTAL FORCES
C305.2.1.3
<em>If the sliding resistance of the foundation material is inadequate to withstand the horizontal forces, as determined in accordance with LRFD 10.6.3.4, provide additional resistance using one or more of the following means, listed in order of preference:</em>
A.  Increase the footing width. B.  Use a footing shear key and utilize only the passive
pressure acting on the key. Locate the shear key within the middle two-thirds of the footing width.
C. Use deep-foundation supported footings. For footings supported on deep foundations, neglect frictional resistance of the footing concrete on soil.
D.  Use ground anchors, struts, deadmen, or soil reinforcements. Extend these elements outside the active failure wedge of the footing or retaining wall. Use only the portion of the horizontal resistance located outside of the active wedge.
Soil reinforcements are generally geogrids or metallic reinforcements that are typically used for mechanically stabilized earth structures.
<em>Do not utilize passive resistance against sliding unless the foundation penetrates below frost depth or soil disturbance. See LRFD 11.6.3.5.</em>
The opposite is also the case: passive resistance can be used if the foundation penetrates below frost depth or probable soil disturbance.
305.2.1.4 389BCONCRETE REINFORCEMENT C305.2.1.4
Locate bottom transverse footing reinforcement (i.e. reinforcement parallel to the centerline of the substructure) at the minimum concrete cover. Locate bottom longitudinal footing reinforcement (i.e. reinforcement perpendicular to the centerline of the substructure) above the bottom transverse footing reinforcement.
Footings for this provision include spread footings and footings supported on deep foundations. Refer to BDM Section 304.4.10 for concrete cover requirements.
Locate the hooks for footing dowels in the plane of the bottom mat of footing concrete reinforcement.
Footing dowels are the reinforcement that laps with the primary (vertical) steel in the substructure unit. This provision provides a location to tie the footing dowel reinforcement.
For piers located within embankment slopes, the minimum footing dowel reinforcement ratio shall be 0.79-in2/ft. Otherwise the minimum footing dowel reinforcement ratio shall be 0.44-in2/ft.
Provide a minimum reinforcement ratio of 0.20 in2/ft at the following footing locations:
A. The bottom of the toe and the top of the heel of a spread footing for a cantilever retaining wall or abutment.
B. The top of all pier footings.

3-45
305.2.1.5 390BDESIGN CONSIDERATIONS C305.2.1.5
For cap and column piers on spread footings placed on existing soils or on embankment fills, provide continuous footings which extend beyond the center of the end column a distance equal to approximately 1/3 of the distance between the end column and the adjacent column.
The continuous footing requirement provides resistance to differential settlement between columns. The footing dimension requirement provides approximately balanced moments.
For cap and column piers with spread footings on bedrock provide separate footings under each column
For grade separation structures, locate the top of pier footings in accordance with BDM Section 305.2.1.2.
The spread footing width for a pier shall not be less than one-fourth the height of the pier where founded on soil and not less than one-fifth the height of the pier where founded on bedrock.
Measure the pier height from the bottom of the footing to the top of the highest beam seat.
The minimum width of abutment and retaining wall spread footings founded on soil shall be one-half the wall height (H). There is no minimum width for abutment and retaining wall spread footings founded on bedrock.
Refer to LRFD Figure 11.6.3.2-1 for a definition of (H). For semi-integral abutments, measure the height to the beam seat for this purpose.
305.2.2 202BSPREAD FOOTINGS ON COHESIONLESS SOILS
For spread footings founded on cohesionless soils, determine settlement due to the incremental loading during the construction sequence.
305.2.3 203BSPREAD FOOTINGS ON COHESIVE SOILS
C305.2.3
Do not found spread footings for piers and abutments on cohesive soils with Undrained Shear Strength (Su) less than 2.0-ksf. There is no limitation on Su for foundation soils under spread footings for all other types of retaining walls.
This limitation also does not apply to culvert headwall and wing wall spread footing foundations. Refer to GDM Section 1400 for guidance.
Do not found spread footings on cohesive soils when secondary settlements will directly affect the performance of the structure over its service life.
305.2.4 204BSPREAD FOOTINGS ON BEDROCK C305.2.4
Use φτ = 0.9 as the sliding resistance factor for pier footings founded on weak or very weak bedrock (Qu &lt; 1.5-ksi).
A sliding resistance check may be non-performed for footings keyed 3-in into slightly strong or stronger bedrock (Qu ≥ 1.5-ksi), as long as there is no evidence of features of the bedrock structure that may constitute planes of weakness such as laminations or interbedding.

305.3 73BDRIVEN PILES
305.3.1 205BGENERAL DISCUSSION C305.3.1
Design driven piles in accordance with LRFD 10.7 and install in accordance with C&amp;MS 507 and 523.
Consider driven piles when they become economically viable, or if they are needed for resistance against lateral and uplift loads. If artesian conditions are encountered, consult with the Office of Geotechnical Engineering regarding pile type selection.
Refer to BDM Section 201.2.1.3 for information to include in the Structure Foundation Exploration Report.
For the piles in each substructure unit, provide the following in the structure general notes:
A. For piles driven to refusal on bedrock, the total factored load in axial compression.
B. For friction piles, the Ultimate Bearing Value (UBV).
C. For laterally loaded piles, externally applied lateral loads and bending moments, and maximum values of internal shear and moment.
Provide a unique number designation for each pile in the plans.
305.3.1.1 391BPILE TYPES C305.3.1.1
Steel H-piles shall meet the requirements of ASTM A572 Grade 50.
The commonly available steel H-pile sizes are HP10x42, HP12x53, and HP14x73. Refer to the AISC Steel Construction Manual for section properties of available H-piles.
Cast-in-place (CIP) reinforced concrete pipe piles shall meet the requirements of ASTM A252 for steel pipe piles Grade 2 (Fy = 35-ksi) or Grade 3 (Fy = 45-ksi). Do not use Grade 1 steel pipe piles. Closed-end CIP reinforced concrete pipe piles shall not exceed 24-in nominal diameter. The Department will define large-diameter open-ended pipe piles as having a minimum 36-in nominal outside diameter.
The commonly available closed-end CIP reinforced concrete pipe pile sizes are 12-in, 14-in, and 16-in nominal diameter. Refer to publication FHWA-NHI-16-009/FHWA-NHI-16-010, Geotechnical Engineering Circular 12 (GEC 12) “Design and Construction of Driven Pile Foundations” for section properties of available CIP reinforced concrete piles.
Specify the wall thickness and Grade of closed-end CIP reinforced concrete pipe piles. The minimum wall thickness is 0.250-in. Increase the wall thickness as necessary to avoid overstressing the pile during driving, as determined by the wave equation drivability analysis required in BDM Section 305.3.1.2.
Start the drivability analysis for CIP piles with Grade 2 material and the minimum wall thickness. Before increasing the wall thickness, switch to Grade 3 material. Choose the appropriate sample Plan note in BDM Section 606 to specify the wall thickness. Specify the material Grade and strength in the Plan note for Design Data provided in BDM Section 602.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-47
It is preferable to specify a single wall thickness across smaller structures (one to three spans) whenever the piles are of the same diameter, so that the piles cannot be mixed up and the wrong piles installed at a substructure unit. If a structure has different size piles at the abutments and the pier(s) – for example 12-inch and 16-inch respectively – then different pile wall thicknesses can be reasonably specified for the two sizes without any worry of mixing up the piles by the pile installer.
Detail large-diameter open-ended pipe piles as filled with Class QC1 concrete to the clean out elevation shown on the plans, after pile installation. Specify the Grade and the wall thickness and increase the thickness as necessary to avoid overstressing the pile during driving, as determined by the wave equation drivability analysis required in BDM Section 305.3.1.2.
If considering large-diameter open-ended pipe piles, consult with the Office of Geotechnical Engineering. The soil inside large-diameter open-ended pipe piles should be removed to the elevation shown on the plans. Clean out requirements should be specified on the plans. Formation of the pile plug often does not occur in large-diameter open-ended pipe piles without providing a steel plate annulus to facilitate intentional plugging. Estimation of pile lengths should be based on an iterative, rigorous analysis, considering potential of pile plug formation during driving.
The Department does not restrict the use of precast reinforced concrete piles or precast prestressed concrete piles.
Currently no construction specifications exist for precast concrete piles.
Do not use timber piles.
305.3.1.2 392BPILE DRIVING HAMMERS C305.3.1.2
Perform a wave equation drivability analysis to determine whether the pile can be driven without overstressing the pile, utilizing a pile driving hammer commonly available in Ohio, to achieve refusal on bedrock, the design Ultimate Bearing Value, or the pile tip elevation. If the analysis indicates blow counts higher than 100 bpf prior to reaching the required bearing depth or resistance, consider this as practical refusal, and choose a hammer of higher rated energy.
Single-acting diesel pile driving hammers are commonly available in Ohio up to a rated energy of up to 44,000-ft-lb which corresponds roughly to a Delmag D 19-42 hammer. Wave equation analyses should typically start with this size hammer. Other types and larger sized pile driving hammers have higher mobilization costs, which should be considered in the economics of the design.
For point bearing piles on bedrock, select a hammer that is capable of reaching and penetrating bedrock for the specified pile type and size. Refusal criteria is met during driving when the pile penetrates into bedrock 1-in or less after receiving at least 20 blows from the pile hammer.
A wave equation analysis is not necessary for point bearing piles on bedrock when all three of the following apply:
A. Bedrock is 50 ft or less in depth. B. All granular soils are medium dense or less in
density (SPT N160 ≤ 30 bpf). C. All cohesive soils are very stiff or less in
consistency (SPT N60 ≤ 30 bpf).
For friction piles, select a pile hammer large enough to achieve the specified Ultimate Bearing Value. Perform a dynamic load test to verify that the Ultimate Bearing Value is achieved. Refer to BDM Section 305.7 for specific pile testing requirements.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-48
If the analysis indicates overstress to the pile, either 1.) increase the yield strength of the pile steel and provide a plan note specifying the new minimum yield strength, 2.) choose a thicker pile wall and provide a plan note specifying the minimum pile wall thickness, or 3.) try a smaller hammer and provide a plan note specifying the pile driving hammer maximum rated energy. If analysis with a Delmag D 19-42 hammer indicates that the required bearing depth or resistance cannot be reached without driving refusal, use a larger hammer and provide a plan note specifying the pile driving hammer minimum rated energy.
A sample note for hammer maximum or minimum rated energy is provided in Section 600.
305.3.2 206BLOAD EFFECTS C305.3.2
For each point bearing pile on bedrock, provide the total factored axial pile load in the plan General Notes.
ODOT C&amp;MS 507.04 provides three criteria to specify proper pile installation depth:
Determine the total factored axial pile load (Qp) using BDM Eq. C305.3.2-1.
A. Refusal  The Refusal criteria is defined in BDM Section
<em>305.3.1.2 and by plan note in BDM Section 600 as pile penetration of an inch or less after receiving at least 20 blows from a pile hammer sufficiently sized to achieve the required depth to bedrock. For piles driven to Refusal, the total factored axial load applied to a point bearing pile on bedrock (Qp) is resisted by the factored axial structural compressive resistance of the pile (Pr) determined according to LRFD 6.15.3.1 Determine the total factored axial pile load as follows:</em>
Qp = Σ ηi γi Qi + ηi γp DD ≤ Pr ................... (C305.3.2-1) Where:
Σ ηi γi Qi = Sum of factored loads for      highest loaded pile at each     substructure unit (kips)
ηi γp DD = Factored drag load per pile (kips);    see BDM Section 305.3.2.2.
<em>ηi  = Load modifier relating to ductility,  redundancy and operational  classification (see LRFD 1.3.2.1)</em>
<em>γi  = Load factor (see LRFD 3.4) γp = Load factor for drag load = 1.05 Pr = factored axial structural compressive</em>
<em>resistance of the pile (LRFD 6.15.3).  Consider the depth of scour as an  unbraced length. If including drag load,  use the resistance factor for steel piles in  compression under good driving  conditions (LRFD 6.5.4.2). Otherwise,  use the resistance factor for steel piles in  compression and  subject to damage due  to severe driving conditions (LRFD  6.5.4.2 and BDM Table 305-1).</em>
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-49
For each friction pile, provide the Ultimate Bearing Value (UBV) in the plan General Notes.
Determine the UBV using BDM Eq. C305.3.2-3.
B. Ultimate Bearing Value (UBV)
<em>The driving criteria for UBV is established in C&amp;MS 507.05 using the results of dynamic pile testing specified in C&amp;MS 523. The Ultimate Bearing Value is the final maximum unfactored resistance that an individual pile is expected to supply. The EOID is the unfactored pile resistance at the end of initial driving defined as Rndr in LRFD 10.3.</em>
Determine the EOID and UBV as follows:
EOID = Rn + RSsc – RSsu    ........................... (C305.3.2-2)
<em>And: UBV = EOID + RSsu    ................................. (C305.3.2-3)</em>
<em>In which: Rn = Nominal Pile Bearing Resistance [LRFD</em>
10.3]
<em>Rn=Qp/φdyn .......................................... (C305.3.2-4) RSsc = Nominal amount of side resistance (kips)</em>
<em>that must be overcome during driving  through soil in the scour zone calculated  using static analysis methods, per LRFD  10.7.3.8.6.</em>
<em>RSsu = Additional amount of resistance (kip) to  account for setup of the side friction after  EOID. See BDM Sections 305.3.2.4 and  305.3.5.9 for how and when to utilize this  value in design.

Provide the estimated lengths of piles on the Final Structure Site Plan.
<em>Determine the estimated length for friction piles using static analysis methods to calculate the length of pile necessary to develop the UBV defined according to BDM Eq. C305.3.2-6.</em>
Estimate pile length for friction piles using the following equation:
UBV = Rp + Rs + RSsc ................................ (C305.3.2-6) Where:
<em>Rp = Nominal pile tip resistance (LRFD  10.7.3.8.6a) (kip)</em>
<em>Rs = Nominal pile side resistance (LRFD 10.7.3.8.6a)  (kip) for soil below the scour zone</em>
When performing static analysis methods for friction piles, do not use the Tomlinson 1979 model in the analyses.
The Tomlinson 1979 model was superseded by the Tomlinson 1980 models; furthermore, LRFD recognizes only the 1980 models.
Only use the Tomlinson 1980 overlying sand model if the overlying layer has (Combined Gravel and Coarse Sand Sizes ≥ 35%) AND (P200 ≤ 30%) AND (PI ≤ 8%). If a &#34;sand&#34; layer does not meet the above qualifications, or if it is intermittent, consider modeling the layer as cohesive.
The Tomlinson 1980 overlying sand model represents the frictional resistance of a cohesive layer as increased by a significant amount by granular material being freed from the overlying sand or sandy gravel layer. This model should not be used for cohesive soil layers below granular layers that consist primarily of fine sands or silts, or which contain a significant portion of fines or a high plasticity, such that a significant amount of coarse sand or gravel cannot be freed from the matrix of the soil. In these cases, the predicted effect is considered unconservative.
Only use the Tomlinson 1980 overlying soft clay model if the overlying layer has an undrained shear strength less than or equal to 750 psf, and an undrained shear strength less than or equal to 1/4 of the undrained shear strength less of the underlying layer.
The Tomlinson 1980 overlying soft clay model represents the frictional resistance of a cohesive layer as reduced by softer overlying clay being drawn down during driving to lubricate the pile. The overlying clay needs to be soft enough to draw down, and significantly weaker than the underlying layer to have an effect.

<em>Where scour is predicted, neglect the pile resistance provided by soil in the scour zone. Use the depth of scour resulting from the design flood, per LRFD 2.6.4.4.2, with Strength and Service Limit State checks.

<em>For friction piles, include the side resistance from the soil within the scour zone (RSsc) in the Ultimate Bearing Value. Determine the UBV according to BDM Section 305.3.2.</em>
A plan note is available in BDM Section 600.
Because the pile will lose support along the scour depth, investigate the structural capacity of the pile considering the depth of the scour as an unbraced length. Also perform a p-y analysis on the pile according to BDM Section 305.1.2 to demonstrate:
A. Lateral stability against overturning failure in the Strength Limit State with the maximum estimated scour depth at the design flood.
B. Lateral stability against overturning failure in the Extreme Event II Limit State with the maximum estimated scour depth at the check flood
C. Excessive deflection in the Service Limit State at the design flood.
<em>Extend the piles to penetrate a minimum of 15-ft below the maximum estimated scour depth. If the required UBV is estimated to be achieved within the 15-ft of embedment below the scour elevation, specify the piles to be installed to a tip elevation.</em>
The maximum estimated scour depth may occur with the design flood, check flood or an overtopping flood of lesser recurrence interval.
305.3.2.2 394BDOWNDRAG &amp; DRAG LOAD C305.3.2.2
Assume downdrag to act if ground settlement of greater than or equal to 0.4-in will occur after pile installation at the substructure unit in question.
For all friction piles subject to downdrag, calculate the location of the neutral plane per the Goudreault and Fellenius (1994) method as described in FHWA-NHI-16-009/FHWA-NHI-16-010, Geotechnical Engineering Circular 12 (GEC 12) “Design and Construction of Driven Pile Foundations,” Section 7.3.5.7. For all point bearing piles on bedrock, consider the neutral plane to be at the top of bedrock.
When soil moves downward relative to the pile, it creates a drag load on, and therefore within, the pile. The downward soil movement creates the potential for downward pile movement. This downward pile movement is referred to as downdrag. The subsurface conditions, pile installation methods, pile loading sequences, as well as the pile and ground surface configuration determine the magnitude of the drag load and the downdrag movement.
Analyze downdrag and drag load according to the Siegel et al. (2013) method as described in GEC 12, Section 7.3.6.1, except as modified below.
The factored structural axial resistance of the pile at the Strength Limit State shall equal or exceed the combined effect of the factored drag load and the sum of factored loads for the highest loaded pile at each substructure using BDM Eq. C305.3.2.2-1.
<em>Use the following equation: Qp = Σ ηi γi Qi + ηi γp DD ≤ Pr ............... (C305.3.2.2-1)</em>
<em>Where: Σ ηi γi Qi = Sum of factored loads for highest</em>
loaded pile at each substructure unit   (kips)
DD = Nominal drag load (downdrag load) per  pile (kips)
γp  = Load factor for drag load = 1.05
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-52
<em>Pr = Factored structural axial resistance per  pile (kips), calculated per BDM Section  305.3.3 and LRFD 6.15.3.1.</em>
<em>When calculating the factored axial structural compressive resistance of the pile (Pr), use the resistance factor for steel piles in compression under good driving conditions (LRFD 6.5.4.2) if including drag load. Otherwise, use the resistance factor for steel piles in compression and subject to damage due to severe driving conditions (LRFD 6.5.4.2 and BDM Table 305-1).</em>
The reasoning for using the resistance factors for piles in compression under good driving conditions when considering drag load is that the maximum load in the pile when including drag load will occur somewhere in the middle of the pile, not at the head or toe of the pile. The highest driving stresses occur at the extreme ends of the pile – either at the head or toe – where driving damage is more likely. Therefore, the lesser resistance factors for piles in compression subject to damage due to severe driving conditions are to only be used for consideration of factored structural axial resistance per pile versus the total factored axial load per pile excluding drag load.
If greater resistance to drag load is necessary, consider using larger piles or increasing the number of piles and reducing the applied load per pile. To reduce or eliminate downdrag, consider preloading the soil so settlement occurs before pile installation. Also consider installing wick drains and an additional earth surcharge load to decrease the amount of time required for settlement to occur. Plan notes regarding pile driving waiting periods are available in BDM Section 600. A Special Provision for Installation of Wick Drains is available from the Office of Geotechnical Engineering.
<em>Drag load is the total sum of skin friction in the downwards direction (negative skin friction) for the length of the pile in contact with the soil above the neutral plane. Calculate skin friction and drag load using static analysis methods, according to LRFD 10.7.3.8.6 assuming 100% mobilization of tip (toe) resistance. Use a structural resistance factor for piles in compression and subject to damage due to severe driving conditions according to LRFD 6.5.4.2.</em>
Alternately, tip resistance versus displacement curves (t-z and q-z curves), along with a comparison to the predicted settlement of the foundation soil, may be used in a more refined iterative approach.
Do not specify battered piles when drag load is anticipated.
The additional bending forces imposed on the piles by the drag load can cause pile deformation and damage.
<em>Evaluate the downdrag movement, as it contributes to pile head settlement, at the geotechnical Service Limit State. Consider the pile downdrag movement (Sdd = settlement due to downdrag) equal to the settlement of the foundation soil at the location of the neutral plane, plus the elastic compression of the pile above the location of the neutral plane due to the effects of the permanent load at the pile head plus the drag load. Calculate settlement of the foundation soils according to LRFD 10.6.2.4. Calculate elastic compression of the pile according to GEC 12, Section 7.3.5.1. Exclude transient loads from the calculation of settlement and elastic compression.</em>
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-53
For point bearing piles on bedrock, include both transient loads and drag load in the computation of total factored axial load per pile, and provide this value in the structure general notes.
For friction piles, do not include both transient loads and drag load in the computation of total factored axial load per pile. If transient loads exceed the value of drag load, include only transient loads. If transient loads are less than the value of drag load, include only the drag load.
305.3.2.3 395BUPLIFT C305.3.2.3
<em>When a pile must resist uplift loads, calculate the uplift resistance in accordance with LRFD 10.7. Use static analysis methods to determine the nominal uplift resistance due to side resistance.</em>
Driven piles under permanent tensile loads are generally not permitted.
Where the estimated pile length is controlled by the required uplift resistance, specify a pile tip elevation
A plan note is available in BDM Section 600.
If site constraints or other factors make permanent tensile loads on driven piles unavoidable, use a redundancy load modifier of ηR = 1.05 for the permanent tensile loads on the foundation elements.
305.3.2.4 396BSETUP C305.3.2.4
<em>When pile setup is addressed according to BDM Section 305.3.5.9.A, determine the components of the nominal pile side resistance according to BDM Eq. C305.3.2.4-1. Determine the EOID and UBV values according to BDM Eq. C305.3.2.4-4 and C305.3.2.4-5 respectively and perform both a “driving resistance” analysis, taking into account the driving losses to side frictional resistance experienced by the pile during driving and prior to setup, and an “ultimate resistance” analysis for the long-term condition after pile setup has occurred. Use BDM Table 305-2 to determine the setup factor for each soil layer based on Soil Class. If the estimated driving resistance indicates driving losses that would increase the length of the pile during driving by more than 10-ft with EOID compared to the UBV, then account for pile setup in the design. Refer to BDM Section 600 for a sample plan notes.</em>
<em>Perform dynamic load testing on the piles to EOID and measure the EOID resistance. Specify a waiting period and restrike dynamic testing of the piles to field verify that the UBV resistance is achieved.</em>
Dissipation of excess pore water pressure in foundation soils after driving can result in increased soil shear strength and additional side friction commonly referred to as Setup.
<em>Typically, driven piles are not designed to account for setup, therefore, RSsu = 0 and the EOID resistance equals UBV resistance. However, if soft cohesive soils are encountered at the site, and pile bearing resistance analysis for the “driving resistance” indicates long estimated pile lengths at EOID, it may prove beneficial to consider setup in the design. Refer to publication FHWA-NHI-16-009 for guidance on the potential for pile setup or relaxation for various soil types.</em>
<em>As noted in BDM Section C305.3.2, determine the Nominal pile side resistance for soil below the scour zone, RS, using static analysis methods according to LRFD 10.7.3.8.6a. Determine the components of this side resistance as follows:</em>
<em>RS = RSndr + RSsu ...................................... (C305.3.2.4-1) In which: RSsu=(1-1/fsu) RS ...................................... (C305.3.2.4-2)</em>

305.3.3 207BPOINT BEARING PILES ON BEDROCK
C305.3.3
Do not specify precast reinforced concrete piles or precast prestressed concrete piles for point bearing pile applications.
When piles are to be driven to refusal on bedrock, consider steel H-piles as the first option. Cast-in-place reinforced concrete pipe piles (including large-diameter open-ended pipe piles) may be considered for point bearing piles on bedrock, provided that all design and construction considerations are adequately addressed.
Refer to BDM Section 305.3.5.6 for pile point requirements.
Provide the total factored load (Qp) in the structural General Notes in accordance with BDM Section 305.3.2.
A sample note is provided in BDM Section 600.
If the total factored load for piles that are to be driven to refusal on bedrock is appreciably less than the maximum factored structural resistance, consideration should be given to increasing the pile spacing or reducing the pile size.
<em>Determine the factored axial structural compressive resistance of the pile (Pr) according to LRFD 6.15.3. If including drag load, use the resistance factor for steel piles in compression under good driving conditions (LRFD 6.5.4.2). Otherwise, use the resistance factor for steel piles in compression and subject to damage due to severe driving conditions (LRFD 6.5.4.2 and BDM Table 305-1). Assume piles are unbraced along the predicted scour depth.</em>
<em>The commonly used H-pile sizes and the factored structural resistance (Pr) for each are listed below:</em>
H-Pile Size Pr
HP10X42 310 kips
HP12X53 380 kips
HP14X73 530 kips
<em>The values listed above for the factored structural resistance are calculated in accordance with LRFD 6.9.4.1 assuming: an axially loaded pile with negligible moment; no appreciable loss of section due to deterioration throughout the life of the structure; a steel yield strength of 50-ksi; a structural resistance factor for H-piles subject to damage due to severe driving conditions (φc = 0.50); and a pile fully braced along its length (l = 0-in). Please note that as l approaches zero, Pe approaches infinity which means Pn equals Po in LRFD Eq. 6.9.4.1.1-1 and Po = FyAg.</em>

In which:
Fe =Fy + 0.85f′c(Ac/As) ............................... (C305.3.3-3) Where:

Ac = cross sectional area of concrete (in2)
<em>As = cross sectional area of steel pile (in2) For piles under combined axial compression and flexure, determine factored structural resistance in accordance with LRFD 6.9.2.2.</em>
Perform wave equation drivability analysis according to BDM Section 305.3.1.2 to determine whether the pile can be driven to refusal on bedrock without overstressing the pile.
305.3.4 208BFRICTION PILES C305.3.4
When friction piles are to be driven, consider closed-end cast-in-place reinforced concrete pipe piles as the first option.
Piles not driven to refusal on bedrock develop their geotechnical resistance by a combination of soil friction or adhesion along the sides of the pile and end bearing on the pile tip. These piles are typically referred to as friction piles.
Provide additional concrete reinforcement inside the pile for capped pile piers as described in BDM Section 306.3.3.2.
This reinforcement provides structural capacity for the concrete pile if the steel shell completely deteriorates. For other pipe pile applications where significant deterioration of the steel shell is not anticipated, the steel pipe provides sufficient reinforcement, and no additional internal concrete reinforcement is required.
Provide the UBV for each substructure unit in the structural General Notes in accordance with BDM Section 305.3.2.
<em>Every pile in a single substructure unit shall be driven to the same UBV as the pile with the maximum factored load in the substructure unit. A sample note is provided in BDM Section 600. The UBV may need to be adjusted during detail design as the design loads for the Service, Strength and Extreme Event Limit States are refined.</em>
<em>Perform wave equation drivability analysis according to BDM Section 305.3.1.2 to determine whether the pile can be driven to the UBV without overstressing the pile utilizing commonly available pile driving hammers. Determine the maximum driving stresses on the pile (σdr) in accordance with LRFD 10.7.8 using φda = 1.00.</em>

When H-piles are used as friction piles, the maximum UBV for commonly used H-pile sizes are listed below:
H-Pile Size Maximum UBV HP10x42 310-kip HP12x53 380-kip HP14x73 530-kip
<em>These maximum UBV values may be significantly less than the structural capacity of a pile in axial compression (Pr) listed in BDM Section C305.3.3. The maximum UBV values for both pile types listed in the above tables are based on pile drivability using commonly available pile hammers, and assuming a 3/8-in pile wall thickness for closed-end CIP reinforced concrete pipe piles. Because there is a large degree of variability inherent in the estimation of these maximum values, these tables should be used as a guide.</em>
If driven piles in cohesive soils are specified at a center-to-center spacing of 6 pile diameters or more, or if driven piles in cohesionless soils are specified at a center-to-center spacing of 2.5 pile diameters or more, ignore group effects for axial loading.
<em>For guidance on group effects for pile groups in axial compression, refer to LRFD 10.7.3.9.</em>
<em>The group efficiency factors for pile groups as given in LRFD 10.7.3.9 for cohesive soils (clay) shall apply to pile groups in soft or very soft soils regardless if the pile cap is in firm contact with the ground.</em>
305.3.5 209BDESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
305.3.5.1 397BMINIMUM PILE SPACING, CLEARANCE AND EMBEDMENT INTO CAP
C305.3.5.1
Maximize the pile spacing based on the selected pile type and size.
Perform an economic analysis when selecting the pile type and size and the pile driving hammer (including cost of mobilization). Keep in mind that friction H-piles tend to drive longer than pipe piles, particularly in granular soils.
The following maximum center-to-center pile spacings by structure type may be used as a guide:
A. In capped pile piers, 7.5-ft.
B. In capped pile abutments, 8-ft. C. In stub abutments, front row, 8-ft. D. In wall type abutments and retaining walls, front
row, 7-ft.
Cap and column piers shall have at least 4 piles per individual footing.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-58
<em>For minimum center-to-center spacing of the piles, refer to LRFD 10.7.1.2.</em>
Reinforce the pile cap to resist bending and shear based on the proposed center-to-center spacing of the piles.
Piles supporting capped pile piers shall be embedded 1.5-ft into the concrete cap. For other substructure units on a single row of piles, the piles shall be embedded 2-ft into the concrete. A 1-ft embedment depth into the concrete footing is required for all other cases. Perform a punching shear analysis to determine the necessary concrete thickness over the top of pile. In every case, there shall be at least 1.5-ft cover over top of pile.
The distance from the edge of a footing to the center of a pile shall be not less than 1.5-ft. The distance from the edge of a concrete pier cap to the side of a pile shall be not less than 9-in.
305.3.5.2 398BESTIMATED PILE LENGTH C305.3.5.2
When estimating pile length for point bearing piles on bedrock, except as noted, assume the pile tip elevation as the elevation on the nearest soil boring where either bedrock coring begins or where SPT refusal blow count occurs with a recovered sample visually classified as bedrock. If using piles placed in prebored holes in bedrock, use the bottom of the prebored hole elevation as the pile tip elevation. If sufficient boring data is available, analyze the dip and strike of the bedrock in all three dimensions. If exploration reveals that the rock dips more than 8H:1V across the width of the unit, specify more than one pile length for the unit in divisions of 5-foot lengths. If there are no borings within 50 feet of the substructure unit, locate the top of rock at the substructure unit by interpolation between borings located to either side of the unit; provide a discussion to this effect in the Analyses and Recommendations section of the Foundation Report.
When estimating pile length for friction piles, use static analysis methods to determine the depth of pile penetration necessary to develop the required Ultimate Bearing Value as described in BDM Section 305.3.2.
The estimated length may need to be adjusted during detail design as the design loads for the Service, Strength and Extreme Event Limit States are refined
Calculate the following pile lengths:
A. Estimated Length = Pile Cutoff Elevation - Pile Tip Elevation
Round Estimated Length up to the nearest 5-ft. Provide the Estimated Length on the Site Plan.
B. Order Length = Estimated Length + 5-ft
Provide the Order Length for each pile in the Structure General Notes.
Note that pile cutoff elevation includes the embedment into the pile cap per BDM Section 305.3.5.1 and free-standing length for capped pile piers. If rounding up to the nearest 5-ft for Estimated Length adds less than a foot, increase to the next 5-foot interval.

305.3.5.3 399BCORROSION AND PROTECTION C305.3.5.3
<em>If the subsurface exploration identifies soil or site conditions considered indicative of potential pile deterioration or corrosion from environmental conditions according to LRFD 10.7.5, verify conditions with laboratory testing of soil samples. Consider soils with an organic content of 4 percent or more as “high organic content”.</em>
For soils that are not indicative of a potential pile corrosion problem, ignore corrosion for steel not exposed to atmospheric conditions over the design life of the structure. Provide pile encasement for portions of piles exposed to atmospheric conditions. The pile encasement shall extend a minimum of 3-ft below the ground line/stream bottom.
A form of pile encasement is detailed on Standard Bridge Drawing CPP-1-08. The top of the encasement shall be located no more than 1-ft from the bottom of the pile cap and the concrete fill shall be sloped to drain.
For soils that are indicative of a potential pile corrosion problem, determine the appropriate corrosion loss rate for carbon steel per Eurocode 3, Part 5, Section 4.4 for the specific environmental conditions at the site. Apply the appropriate corrosion loss rate to all surfaces of the piles in the respective exposure area.
Design the steel pile section to retain the required factored structural resistance after discounting corrosion loss and provide a plan note that addresses the amount of additional pile section specified to account for the corrosion loss. Alternately, provide corrosion protection for the piles.
<em>Corrosion protection for the pile steel shall consist of a zinc coating or concrete encasement. For zinc coatings, estimate the corrosion loss rate as 1/2 the respective loss rate for carbon steel. The minimum thickness for zinc coating is 4 mils. Treat steel piles with precast concrete encasement as precast reinforced concrete piles for the purposes of geotechnical resistance, pile handling and installation, and limits on driving stresses. For concrete piles or concrete encasement, if the environmental conditions indicate a soil chloride content ≥500 ppm, a sulfate content ≥500 ppm, or a pH &lt;5, then retain the services of a corrosion specialist in order to develop an appropriate corrosion-inhibiting mix design or concrete cover thickness over the steel, per LRFD 5.10.1, 5.14.2, and C10.7.5.</em>

305.3.5.5 401B UCKLING AND LATERAL STABILITY
C305.3.5.5
For free-standing piles, analyze the piles for buckling and lateral stability as unsupported columns above the point of fixity with scour depths included.
Buckling and lateral stability analysis applies particularly to capped pile piers, large-diameter open-ended pipe piles supporting single pier columns, and conventional piles subject to scour.
<em>Determine the depth to the point of fixity in accordance with LRFD 10.7.3.13.4.</em>
The equations in LRFD C10.7.3.13.4 may be used to determine depth to fixity for preliminary design.
305.3.5.6 402BSTEEL PILE POINTS OR SHOES C305.3.5.6
To protect the tips of H-piles, CIP pipe piles and open-ended pipe piles, provide steel points, conical points or cutting shoes respectively for each of the following criteria:
Sample plan notes for each of the pile requirements are provided in BDM Section 600.
A. Piling is driven to refusal on bedrock with an unconfined compressive strength ≥ 7.5-ksi, AND</li>
<li>Overburden of any thickness consisting primarily of granular soils, OR
Steel points need not be specified when the piles are driven to refusal on weaker bedrock because driving stresses at the tip should not be damaging. Refer to SGE Table 600.10 for more information regarding the strength of bedrock.</li>
<li>Overburden less than 50-ft consisting primarily of cohesive soil.
When the overburden is greater than 50-ft consisting primarily of cohesive soils, there should be enough side friction to prevent damaging stress at the pile tips.
B. Piling is driven through overburden containing boulders
Also give consideration to include steel pile points or shoes if the overburden contains significant cobbles (encountered widespread, difficult drilling noted, or cobbles larger than 6 inches noted).
C. Piling is driven through very dense granular soils of 10 feet or greater in thickness
This assumes that the pile would be going through a substantial thickness of dense granular soils, such that pile driving stresses at the tip would prove excessive.
D. Piling is driven to refusal on bedrock meeting the following criteria:</li>
<li>Unconfined compressive strength ≥ 1.5-ksi, AND</li>
<li>Angle between inclined bedrock and axis of the pile is less than 60°, AND</li>
<li>Overburden immediately above bedrock is:  a. Stiff or weaker cohesive soil, or  b. Granular soil
This provision helps to facilitate penetration of piles into the bedrock without skipping off the surface.

305.3.5.7 403BMINIMUM PILE PENETRATION REQUIREMENTS
C305.3.5.7
When driving piles through new embankment, the piles shall penetrate a minimum distance of 10-ft into the underlying in-situ soils. If piles are to be driven through 15-ft or more of new embankment, specify prebored holes, in accordance with C&amp;MS 507.11. Clearly indicate the locations and lengths of all prebored holes in the plans. For design purposes, ignore the effect of skin friction along the length of the prebored holes for bearing resistance; for drivability analyses, include skin friction along the prebored length as if it is sand with a 28° friction angle. The specified length of the prebored hole shall be the height of the new embankment at each pile location.
For sleeved piles placed through MSE fill, ignore the effect of skin friction along the length of the sleeve for bearing resistance and for drivability analyses.
There are two potential types of sleeve in general use (a sand-filled corrugated polyethylene smooth lined pipe or a prefabricated friction reduction pile sleeve). If pile driving will occur after sleeving, they must be considered in the design. For the sand-filled smooth lined pipe sleeve, skin friction along the sleeved length is as for sand with a 28° friction angle. For the prefabricated friction reduction pile sleeve, skin friction along the sleeved length is as for sand with a 10° friction angle.
When placing driven pile foundations through an MSE wall backfill, the piles shall penetrate a minimum distance of 15-ft into the underlying in-situ soils below the leveling pad elevation. If bedrock exists within the minimum penetration length, place the prebored in drilled holes that extend a maximum of 5-ft into bedrock.
Where bedrock is encountered in the penetration length:
A. For in-situ soil depth ≤ 10-ft, extend 5-ft into rock. B. For in-situ soil depth &gt; 10-ft, total penetration depth
including into rock = 15-ft
For applications other than MSE walls, the piles shall penetrate a minimum distance of 10-ft into in-situ material. If bedrock exists within the 10-ft length, place the piles in prebored holes that extend a minimum of 5-ft into bedrock. If bedrock unconfined compressive strength &lt; 1.5-ksi, extend the prebored holes a minimum of 10-ft into bedrock.
Unlike under MSE walls, this provision accommodates the possibility of a single row of piles with significant lateral loads and bending moments. The 5-ft extension into rock should create a point of fixity for pile stability where shallow rock is encountered.
<em>Place the piles in the prebored holes without driving the piles. For integral abutment piles, place Class QC Misc. concrete in the bottom 5 feet of the prebored hole; otherwise place the concrete in the prebored holes to the top of bedrock. When piles are placed in drilled holes, determine the nominal structural resistance of the piles according to BDM Section 305.3.3 using the resistance factor for axial compression, φc = 0.95 [LRFD 6.5.4.2 for steel columns].</em>
Include the prebored holes with C&amp;MS ITEM 507 PREBORED HOLES, AS PER PLAN for payment. The Department will include the backfill concrete with the prebored holes for payment. The Department will pay for the piles under Item 507 Steel Piles HP_x_, Furnished, As Per Plan with the placement into the prebored holes incidental to the pay item. Do not include an ITEM 507 PILES DRIVEN pay item. Sample plan notes are provided in BDM Section 600.

305.3.5.8 404B ATTERED PILES C305.3.5.8
Only use battered piles if a p-y analysis in accordance with BDM Section 305.1.2 predicts excessive deflection or inadequate fixity, such that the piles fail to meet the serviceability requirements of BDM Section 305.1.3.
Battered piles are not preferred, as they are more expensive and difficult to construct than vertical deep foundation elements.
Do not extend battered piles beyond the limits of the right-of-way. Ensure that the location and alignment of the proposed piles do not conflict with deep foundation elements from the adjacent or existing substructure units.
Piles battered transverse to the centerline of a bridge should be avoided. A batter of 1:4 (H:V) is considered desirable, but in cases where the lateral resistance of the piles is inadequate to counteract the horizontal forces transmitted to the foundation, a batter of 1:3 (H:V) may be specified.
Do not specify battered piles when drag load is anticipated, unless piles can be driven after the construction of the embankment, the specified minimum waiting period for consolidation of in-situ soils has concluded, and the remaining settlements are anticipated to be less than 0.4-in.
The additional bending forces imposed on the piles by the drag load can cause pile deformation and damage.
For skewed bridges, batter abutment piles normal to the centerline of bearings.
Do not batter piles less than 15-ft in length and driven to refusal on bedrock.
305.3.5.9 405BPILE SETUP AND RELAXATION C305.3.5.9
If the subsurface geotechnical conditions at the site indicate the potential for pile setup on friction piles, and the estimated driving resistance indicates driving losses that would increase the length of the pile during driving by more than 10-ft with EOID compared to the UBV, then account for pile setup in the design. Utilize one of the following three alternatives for the design:
A. Drive all piles to the full Estimated Length, perform dynamic load testing on the first two piles driven and then restrike testing on the same two piles after a specified waiting period, in order to verify setup and the UBV capacity as shown in the plans, or
B. Specify the performance of a site-specific construction evaluation utilizing variable length driving of the first four production piles and restrike testing in order to determine a specific pile tip elevation to be used during construction, or
Refer to publication FHWA-NHI-16-009/FHWA-NHI-16-010, Geotechnical Engineering Circular 12 (GEC 12) “Design and Construction of Driven Pile Foundations” for guidance on the potential for pile setup or relaxation for various soil types.
<em>Pile setup can potentially result in upwards of a six-fold increase in the UBV compared to EOID. Conversely, if the loss of resistance during driving is not realized in design, this can result in substantial pile quantity overruns during construction. Realization of pile setup in design can therefore result in substantial pile quantity savings. A site-specific pre-construction evaluation utilizing test piles (Alternative C) should be considered if over 10,000-ft of piles are specified.</em>
C. Specify the performance of a site-specific pre-construction evaluation utilizing test piles and restrike testing in order to determine values of EOID and UBV along with pile driving criteria to be used during construction.
<em>If pile setup is realized in the design, specify restrike dynamic testing of the piles to field verify the UBV in axial compression.</em>
Plan notes for all three of the above alternatives are available in BDM Section 600.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-63
If the subsurface geotechnical conditions at the site indicate the potential for pile relaxation for friction piles, make no change to the design regarding the nominal resistance provided at the pile tip. Setup may still be considered for the nominal resistance provided along the side of the pile.
<em>Pile relaxation can significantly reduce UBV compared to EOID in heavily over-consolidated clays and in dense saturated silts and fine sands. Research has shown relaxion related losses as much as 40%. However, the amount of displacement to re-mobilize the full UBV is considered small, and it is routinely neglected in design.</em>
If the potential for pile setup or relaxation is indicated for point bearing piles on bedrock, make no change to the design.
For point bearing piles on bedrock, while pile setup will doubtless increase the overall pile bearing resistance some unknown amount, it is ignored in design, since soil friction resistance is not included in the pile bearing resistance due to the large difference in displacement necessary to mobilize side resistance compared to tip resistance. Conversely, while relaxation in the bedrock at the pile tip will doubtless decrease the overall pile bearing resistance, this is also ignored, as the additional displacement necessary to re-mobilize the tip resistance is considered negligible
305.3.6 210BVIBRATION MONITORING C305.3.6
If pile driving with a hammer having a rated energy of 44,000-ft-lb or smaller is to be performed within 200-ft of an existing building, perform a vibration impact assessment in accordance with the guidelines provided in the U.S. Federal Transit Administration (FTA) guidance manual, “Transit Noise and Vibration Impact Assessment,” Final Report FTA-VA-90-1003-06. In this event, use PPVref = 0.644 in/sec.
As noted in BDM Section C305.3.1.2, single-acting diesel pile driving hammers having a rated energy of up to 44,000-ft-lb are commonly available in Ohio. The 200-ft proximity limit is reasonably conservative for conventional pile driving using commonly available pile hammers. For driving of large-diameter piles or the use of higher rated hammers, the proximity limit would need to be extended and an increase in PPVref would also be necessary.
For the vibration impact damage assessment, use the equation provided in Section 7.1 of NCHRP 25-25/Task 72 “Current Practices to Address Construction Vibration and Potential Effects to Historic Buildings Adjacent to Transportation Projects”, with the following values of the attenuation exponent, n:
The recommended values of “n” are within the range of published data and are considered conservative. For additional guidance and commentary on the use of this equation and performance of the vibration impact assessment, see CalTrans Transportation and Construction Induced Vibration Guidance Manual.

305.3.7 211BEMBANKMENT CONSTRUCTION CONSTRAINTS
C305.3.7
Refer to BDM Section 305.3.2.2 regarding downdrag and drag load effects from new embankment settlement, and potential methods of remediation. Refer to BDM Section 305.3.5.7 regarding pile resistance and embedment through new embankments. Refer to BDM Section 305.3.5.8 regarding new embankment settlement effects on battered piles.
When driving piles through new embankment, special considerations with respect to settlement, downdrag, additional loading effects, and resistance of the pile may be necessary.
305.4 74BDRILLED SHAFTS C305.4
Design drilled shafts in accordance with LRFD 10.8 and construct in accordance with C&amp;MS 524.
Drilled shafts should be considered when their use would:
A.  Prevent the need for cofferdams
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-65
B. Become economically viable due to high design loads
C. Improve the structural stability in a scour event.
D. Provide resistance against lateral and uplift loads E. Accommodate sites where the depth to bedrock is
too short for adequate pile embedment but too deep for spread footings
F. Accommodate the site concerns associated with the pile driving process (vibrations, interference due to battered piles, etc.).
Refer to BDM Section 201.2.1.3 for information to include in the Structure Foundation Exploration Report.
Do not specify drilled shafts with an enlarged base (bell, or underream).
Belled shafts are difficult to construct under water or with slurry and the bell will often collapse in non-cohesive soils. Cleaning of the base of the drilled shaft and inspection within the bell is also difficult to conduct
305.4.1 212BLOAD EFFECTS C305.4.1
Provide the total factored load as well as the side and tip resistance for each drilled shaft in the structure General Notes. For laterally loaded drilled shafts, provide the total factored externally applied lateral and moment bending loads, and the maximum factored values of the internal shear and moment.
Sample plan notes are provided in BDM Section 600.
Determine the total factored axial drilled shaft load (Q) using BDM Eq. C305.4.1-1. For consideration of geotechnical resistance in rock-socketed drilled shafts and for structural resistance in drilled shafts subject to downdrag, include the drag load (DD); for geotechnical resistance in friction drilled shafts, DD = 0.
Determine the total factored axial drilled shaft load as follows:
Q = Σ ηi γi Qi + ηi γp DD ≤ RR ≤ Pr ........... (C305.4.1-1) In which:
Q = Total factored load (kips) in axial    compression per shaft for highest loaded  drilled shaft at each substructure unit.  This will include the loads imposed by  the supported infrastructure and the drag  load. This is resisted by the factored fully  mobilized geotechnical resistance of the  shaft; factored load versus the axial  structural resistance of the shaft will be  considered separately (See BDM Section  305.4.1.2).
Σ ηi γi Qi = Sum of factored loads for highest    loaded drilled shaft at each     substructure unit (kips)
ηi γp DD = Factored drag load per drilled shaft    (kips) (See BDM Section 305.4.1.2)
<em>ηi = Load modifier relating to ductility,  redundancy and operational  classification (see LRFD 1.3.2.1)</em>

3-66
<em>γi = Load factor (see LRFD 3.4) γp = Load factor for drag load = 1.05</em>
RR = Factored geotechnical resistance at the  Strength Limit State (kips)
<em>Pr = Factored structural axial resistance per  drilled shaft (kips), calculated according  to LRFD 5.6.4.4.</em>
Determine the factored geotechnical resistance (RR) for axial compression of drilled shafts using BDM Eq. C305.4.1-2
The factored geotechnical resistance in axial compression of drilled shafts required to support the factored load in axial compression is provided by the tip and side resistance in only the rock socket for rock-socketed drilled shafts, and by the tip and side resistance in the overburden soil for friction drilled shafts (see BDM Section 305.4.1.2).
RR = φRn = φqpRP + φqsRS ................... (C305.4.1-2) In which:
Rn = Nominal resistance in axial compression  (kips)
<em>RP = Nominal drilled shaft tip resistance (kips) φqp = Resistance factor for tip resistance</em>
RS = Nominal drilled shaft side resistance  (kips)
φqs = Resistance factor for shaft side resistance Determine the design depth for drilled shafts using static analysis methods to calculate the depth of drilled shaft necessary to develop the factored resistance in axial compression.
<em>When a substructure is supported on only a single drilled shaft, apply a reduction factor of 0.8 to RR.</em>
305.4.1.1 406BSCOUR C305.4.1.1
Neglect the shaft resistance provided by soil or non-scour resistant rock in the scour zone. Assess scour resistant rock according to BDM Section 305.2.1.2.b. Use the depth of scour resulting from the design flood, with Strength and Service Limit State checks. Use the depth of scour resulting from the check flood with Extreme Event II Limit State checks.
<em>The design flood and check flood are defined in LRFD 2.6.4.4.2.</em>
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-67
<em>Extend friction drilled shafts to penetrate a minimum of 15-ft below the controlling scour elevation. If socketed into non-scour resistant bedrock, when the rock has Qu &lt; 2.5-ksi, extend drilled shafts to penetrate a minimum of 10-ft below the controlling scour elevation in the bedrock; when the rock has Qu ≥ 2.5-ksi, extend drilled shafts to penetrate a minimum of 5-ft below the controlling scour elevation in the bedrock. If socketed into scour resistant bedrock, design the length of the bedrock socket based solely on the requirements of axial resistance in accordance with LRFD 10.8.3.5.4 and of lateral stability.</em>
Because the drilled shaft will lose support along the scour depth, investigate the structural capacity of the shaft considering the depth of the scour as an unbraced length. Also perform a p-y analysis on the drilled shaft according to BDM Section 305.1.2 to demonstrate lateral stability against:
A. Overturning failure in the Strength Limit State with the maximum estimated scour depth at the design flood, and
B. Overturning failure in the Extreme Event II Limit State with the maximum estimated scour depth at the check flood, and
C. Excessive deflection in the Service Limit State.
305.4.1.2 407BDOWNDRAG AND DRAG LOAD C305.4.1.2
Assume downdrag to act if ground settlement ≥ 0.4-in will occur after drilled shaft installation at the substructure unit in question.
When soil moves downward relative to the drilled shaft, it creates a drag load on, and therefore within, the shaft. The downward soil movement creates the potential for downward drilled shaft movement. This downward drilled shaft movement is referred to as downdrag. The subsurface conditions, shaft installation methods, shaft loading sequences, as well as the shaft and ground surface configuration determine the magnitude of the drag load and the downdrag movement.
If greater resistance to drag load is necessary, consider using larger drilled shafts or increasing the number of drilled shafts and reducing the applied load per drilled shaft. To reduce or eliminate downdrag, consider preloading the soil so settlement occurs before drilled shaft installation. Also consider installing wick drains and an additional earth surcharge load to decrease the amount of time required for settlement to occur.
A Special Provision for Installation of Wick Drains is available from the Office of Geotechnical Engineering.
For all rock-socketed drilled shafts or drilled shafts founded on top of bedrock, consider the neutral plane to be at the top of bedrock.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-68
Do not use friction drilled shaft foundations when the downdrag is calculated to induce settlements on the structure that will exceed the acceptable settlement criteria as described in BDM Section 305.1.3.
Downdrag is a very complex phenomenon for friction drilled shafts, involving partial mobilizations of side and tip resistances in both the positive and negative directions, and can only be fully analyzed with advanced computerized solutions; even in this case, caution must be used, as research has not definitively established the soil-structure interaction relationships to a point where accurate t-z and q-w curves can be predicted. For these reasons, ODOT prefers not to use of friction drilled shafts subject to downdrag.
For friction drilled shafts subject to downdrag, use either the simplified hand-calculation method described in FHWA-NHI-10-016, Geotechnical Engineering Circular 10 (GEC 10) “Drilled Shafts: Construction Procedures and LRFD Design Methods,” Section 13.6.3 to calculate the location of the neutral plane, or utilize a more refined computerized analysis utilizing soil and structure springs with t-z and q-w curves established from a computerized solution.
The maximum total factored axial load per shaft will be at the location of the neutral plane.
Analyze downdrag and drag load according to the method described in GEC 10, Section 13.6, and as described below.
Evaluate the total factored axial load per shaft, including drag load at the structural Strength Limit State using BDM Eq. C305.4.1-1.
<em>Drag load is the total sum of skin friction in the downwards direction (negative skin friction) for the full length of the shaft in contact with the soil above the neutral plane. Calculate skin friction and drag load using static analysis methods, according to LRFD 10.8.3.5 and GEC 10, Section 13.6. In this calculation, assume an initial base settlement wb and associated mobilization of tip (base) resistance either based on integration of the load displacement curves for both side resistance and end bearing according to LRFD 10.8.2.2 or by utilizing advanced numerical modelling to integrate a series of t-z and q-w curves generated through a computerized solution according to GEC 10, Appendix D. Use a structural resistance factor for drilled shafts as reinforced concrete columns in compression in accordance with LRFD 5.5.4.2 (typically, φc = 0.75 for a compression-controlled section with spirals).</em>
<em>Evaluate the downdrag movement, as it contributes to drilled shaft head settlement, at the geotechnical Service Limit State. Consider the shaft downdrag movement (Sdd = settlement due to downdrag) equal to the settlement of the foundation soil at the location of the neutral plane, plus the elastic compression of the shaft above the location of the neutral plane due to the effects of the permanent load at the pile head plus the drag load.</em>
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-69
<em>Calculate settlement of the foundation soils according to LRFD 10.6.2.4. Calculate elastic compression of the drilled shaft according to GEC 10, Section 14.4.2.1. Exclude transient loads from the calculation of settlement and elastic compression.</em>
For rock-socketed drilled shafts or drilled shafts founded on top of bedrock, include both transient loads and drag load in the computation of total factored axial load per shaft, and provide this value in the structure general notes.
For friction drilled shafts, do not include both transient loads and drag load in the computation of total factored axial load per shaft. If transient loads exceed the value of drag load, include only transient loads. If transient loads are less than the value of drag load, include only the drag load.
305.4.1.3 408BUPLIFT C305.4.1.3
<em>Calculate drilled shaft uplift resistance according to LRFD 10.8 using static analysis methods to determine the nominal uplift resistance due to side resistance.</em>
Where the drilled shaft length is controlled by the required uplift resistance, specify a drilled shaft tip elevation.
A plan note is available in BDM Section 600.
<em>If site constraints or other factors make permanent tensile loads on drilled shafts unavoidable, use a redundancy load modifier of ηR = 1.05 for the permanent tensile loads on the foundation elements.</em>
The Department will generally not permit the use of Drilled shafts under permanent tensile loads.
305.4.2 213BROCK-SOCKETED DRILLED SHAFTS
C305.4.2
<em>For competent bedrock with a minimum rock socket length equal to 1.5 times the rock socket diameter, use LRFD Eq. 10.8.3.5.4c-1 to evaluate the nominal unit tip resistance of the bedrock.</em>
Competent bedrock is defined as rock that does not contain adverse jointing, open solution cavities, or joints that are filled with weathered material that would affect the bearing resistance of the rock, within a distance equal to two socket diameters below the tip of the drilled shaft rock socket.
<em>For all other rock, provide a justification in the Foundation Report and evaluate the nominal unit tip resistance of the rock mass through Geological Strength Index (GSI) and LRFD Eq. 10.8.3.5.4c-2.</em>
Neglect side resistance for rock sockets with a length less than 1.5 times the rock socket diameter. Otherwise, neglect the contribution to skin friction provided by the top 2-ft of the rock socket.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-70
When drilled shafts are socketed into bedrock, do not specify the tip elevation. Instead, provide the approximate top of the bedrock elevation and the length of the bedrock socket in the profile view on the Final Structure Site Plan.
If the bedrock is weak or disintegrated, and the designer anticipates difficulty verifying the top of bedrock during construction, a tip elevation may be specified.
<em>If a rock socket is not necessary either for bearing or lateral resistance, and the bedrock is competent slightly strong or stronger rock, drilled shafts may be founded on top of the bedrock, or utilize a rock socket length of less than 1.5 times the rock socket diameter. In this case, use LRFD Eq. 10.8.3.5.4c-2 to evaluate the nominal unit tip resistance of the bedrock.</em>
This type of drilled shaft will usually not have a reduction in diameter for a rock socket, in which case, the drilled shaft diameter in the soil overburden should be considered as the rock socket diameter for determining its length.
For rock-socketed drilled shafts or drilled shafts founded on top of bedrock, neglect the contribution to side resistance from the soil overburden.
The amount of deformation necessary to mobilize the tip resistance in rock is much less than that to mobilize the side resistance in soil
For drilled shafts socketed into interbedded rock, use a composite of the unconfined compressive strength of the interbedded rock types to calculate the side and tip resistance.
To calculate the composite strength, multiply the unconfined compressive strength of each interbedded rock type by the percentage of that rock type in the interbed, and then sum the result.
305.4.3 214BFRICTION DRILLED SHAFTS C305.4.3
Perform load testing at each substructure unit supported by friction drilled shafts. Specify:
A. a number of high-strain dynamic load tests in accordance with BDM Table 305-1, or
<em>B. a number of static load tests based on site variability recommendations in LRFD C10.5.5.2.3 and C10.5.5.2.4, or a minimum of one per structure, or</em>
C. a combination of high-strain dynamic and static load tests in accordance with BDM Table 305-1.
Use a resistance factor φdyn for geotechnical axial resistance in accordance with the specified number of high-strain dynamic and static load tests, based on the appropriate row in BDM Table 305-1.
Show the tip elevation of friction drilled shafts on the Final Structure Site Plan.
<em>For friction drilled shafts in cohesive soils, except as noted below, neglect the contribution of side resistance for portions of the length of the drilled shaft as specified in LRFD 10.8.3.5.1. Do not neglect the upper 5-ft if the top of the shaft is buried greater than 5-ft, or there is a buried drilled shaft cap above the drilled shaft.</em>
If friction drilled shafts in cohesive soils are specified at a center-to-center spacing of 6 drilled shaft diameters or more, or if friction drilled shafts in cohesionless soils are specified at a center-to-center spacing of 4 drilled shaft diameters or more, ignore group effects for axial loading.
<em>For guidance on group effects for axially loaded friction drilled shafts, refer to LRFD 10.8.3.6.</em>

305.4.4 215BDESIGN CONSIDERATIONS C305.4.4
Provide a unique number designation for each drilled shaft in the Plans.
The designer may choose to number the drilled shafts on the individual substructure plan sheet or on a separate drilled shaft foundation layout sheet.
For pier columns supported directly on drilled shafts, the top of the drilled shaft shall be 1 foot above the OHWM for piers in water, and 1 foot below the ground surface for piers not in water.
For drilled shafts with 4.5-ksi Class QC 4 or Class QC 5 concrete, assume a concrete strength of 4.0-ksi in the design. For a concrete strength above 4.5-ksi, assume a strength of 0.90 f′c in the design.
The reason for the strength reduction in design is to account for potential poor placement control during construction, and the inability to inspect the placement.
Drilled shafts shall be plumb. Do not batter drilled shafts.
Where casings are to be left in place, provide a plan note on either the Estimated Quantities or General Notes sheet.
Provide a construction joint between the top of a drilled shaft and the bottom of the supported substructure element.
305.4.4.1 409BDRILLED SHAFT SPACING, CLEARANCE, AND EMBEDMENT INTO CAP
C305.4.4.1
Maximize the drilled shaft spacing based on the factored resistance in axial compression, considering redundancy and group effects.
<em>For guidance on center-to-center spacing of drilled shafts, refer to LRFD 10.8.1.2.</em>
The drilled shaft cap shall be adequately reinforced based on the proposed center-to-center spacing of the drilled shafts. Perform a punching shear analysis of the drilled shaft cap to determine the necessary cap thickness.
The distance from the edge of a drilled shaft cap to the side of a drilled shaft shall be not less than 6-in.
305.4.4.2 410BDRILLED SHAFT SIZE C305.4.4.2
Drilled shafts that directly support pier columns shall be 6-in larger in diameter than the diameter of the supported pier column. The minimum diameter for drilled shafts that directly support pier columns shall be 42-in. The minimum diameter for drilled shafts that support all other substructure types shall be 36-in. The rock socket diameter shall be 6-in less than the diameter of the drilled shaft in the soil overburden
The shaft diameter is specified to be 6-in larger than the column diameter to allow for the misalignment of drilled shafts that directly support pier columns. Drilled shafts founded on top of the bedrock or utilizing a rock socket length of less than 1.5 times the rock socket diameter need not have a reduction in diameter for a rock socket
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-72
The design diameter of the drilled shaft shall include an allowance for minimum concrete cover over the concrete reinforcement. For socketed drilled shafts, the minimum cover applies within the rock socket which will in turn correspondingly increase the concrete cover in the soil overburden. The minimum concrete cover is as follows:
The increase in concrete cover with respect to increasing drilled shaft diameter is due to allowance for placement tolerance given potential misalignment or “wander” in the drilled shaft tooling.
A. 3.0-in for shafts ≤ 3&#39;-0&#34; diameter
B. 4.0-in for &gt; 3&#39;-0&#34; but &lt; 5&#39;-0&#34; diameter
C. 6.0-in for shafts ≥ 5&#39;-0&#34; diameter
Show the Drilled shaft diameters on the Final Structure Site Plan.
305.4.4.3 411BCONCRETE REINFORCEMENT C305.4.4.3
The clear distance between parallel longitudinal bars and between transverse reinforcement shall be five times the maximum aggregate size.
The maximum aggregate size for an ODOT QC5 mix design according to C&amp;MS Table 499.03-1 is 3/8-in or 1-in. If mass concrete provisions govern, please note that QC4 mix designs have a nominal 1-in maximum aggregate size requirement according to C&amp;MS 499.03. A plan note modifying the nominal maximum coarse aggregate size in the drilled shaft QC5 or QC4 mix design is available in BDM Section 600.
Where reinforcement spacing cannot be met between parallel longitudinal bars, consideration may be given to bundling of bars or to specifying an inner and outer reinforcing cage. Inner and outer reinforcing cages should only be considered when bundling of bars is impractical. Consideration may also be given to embedding a steel beam section within the drilled shaft. A steel beam is particularly useful for increasing lateral resistance.
Provide either spirals or ties as the transverse reinforcement for drilled shafts.
<em>For temporarily cased or uncased drilled shafts, meet the requirements of LRFD Eq. 5.11.4.1.4-1 and use a minimum #4 bar for the transverse reinforcement Do not use LRFD Eq. 5.6.4.6-1.</em>
<em>LRFD Eq. 5.6.4.6-1 provides erroneous results based on the ratio of Ag/Ac. As the concrete cover increases, impractical areas of transverse reinforcement are required. LRFD Eq. 5.11.4.1.4-1 provides the volumetric reinforcement requirements for confinement of primary steel at locations where plastic hinges are formed during seismic events. This provision of the BDM applies LRFD Eq 5.11.4.1.4-1 to the entire length of the drilled shaft.</em>

<em>When using the minimum concrete cover in BDM Section 305.4.4.2 in combination with LRFD Eq. 5.11.4.1.4-1 and the clear distance provision described in BDM Section 305.4.4.3 the spiral reinforcing becomes standardized. BDM Table 305-3 below provides the spiral pitch and bar size for each drilled shaft diameter. It should be noted that when the drilled shaft diameter is greater than 72-in the spiral would need to be a #6 bar. Not all rebar fabricators carry spools of #6 bar. Therefore, when the drilled shaft is greater than 72-in ties should be considered rather than spiral reinforcement.</em>

For drilled shafts with permanent casing, use a #4 bar size with a pitch or spacing of 12-in for the transverse reinforcement.
Provide a construction joint between the top of the drilled shaft and the bottom of any supported substructure element.
In the case of a directly supported column, the designer should specify concrete reinforcement that incorporates the required lap splices at the construction joint. The developed lap splice should allow for both the required lap and minimum cover arising from the misalignment of the drilled shaft with respect to the column. One possible alternative that incorporates a lap splice is shown in BDM Figure 305-4. In this example, the use of ties above the construction joint allows for 3-in of misalignment of the drilled shaft and column as shown in BDM Figure 305-4 but does require an analysis considering a smaller core area.

When the exposed length of the pier column is relatively short, a single full-length concrete reinforcement cage extending from the bottom of the drilled shaft into the pier cap may be specified while maintaining a minimum 3-in concrete cover within the pier column.
305.4.4.4 412BDRILLED SHAFT DESIGN DEPTH C305.4.4.4
When determining design depth for rock-socketed drilled shafts, assume the top of the bedrock socket as the elevation on the nearest soil boring where the top of rock (TR) is identified.
If a series of soil borings indicate a sloping top of rock, interpolation between borings may be used.
When determining design depth for friction drilled shafts, use static analysis methods to determine the penetration depth necessary to develop the required factored resistance in axial compression as described in BDM Section 305.4.1 using geotechnical resistance factors as specified in BDM Table 305-1.
The design depth may need to be adjusted during detail design as the design loads for the Service, Strength and Extreme Event Limit States are refined.
When placing drilled shafts through new embankment, the shafts shall penetrate a minimum distance of 10-ft into the existing soils.
When placing drilled shafts through an MSE wall backfill, the shafts shall penetrate a minimum distance of 15-ft into the existing soils below the leveling pad elevation. If bedrock exists within the minimum penetration length, the drilled shafts shall be socketed into bedrock a minimum of 5-ft.
If bedrock is within 10-ft of the ground surface, or within 10-ft of the bottom of the drilled shaft cap, the drilled shafts shall be socketed into bedrock a minimum of 5-ft.

C305.4.5
Specify Thermal Integrity Profiling (TIP) testing according to ASTM D7949 Method B for a minimum of 10% of all drilled shaft structure foundation elements, including at least one shaft per substructure unit.
TIP testing can be waived for very shallow, permanent cased, or dry shafts. In the first case, very shallow shafts are defined as 30-ft or less in total length or 30-ft or less to rock and a rock socket length of 20-ft or less. In the last case, dry shafts are defined as construction being anticipated by the Dry Construction Method in accordance with C&amp;MS524.04.A.
Specify TIP testing for 100% of all drilled shaft structure foundation elements meeting any of the following conditions:
A. Nominal shaft diameter &gt; 60-in B. Substructure supported by a single drilled shaft.
C. Shaft constructed using the Wet Construction Method or Temporary Casing Construction Method
See BDM Section C305.4.4.6 for definition of the Wet Construction Method; see C&amp;MS 524.04.C for a description of the Temporary Casing Construction Method.
For drilled shaft structure foundation elements with nominal diameters ≥ 84-in, also specify Crosshole Sonic Logging (CSL) testing in accordance with ASTM D6760.
TIP is performed per Supplemental Specification 894. A Special Provision for CSL is available from the Office of Geotechnical Engineering. Additional drilled shaft integrity testing methods not listed here may be considered based upon a justification study. Refer to BDM Section 201.2.1.3.c for more information.

C305.4.6
Refer to BDM Section 305.4.1.2 regarding downdrag and drag load effects from new embankment settlement, and potential methods of remediation. Refer to BDM Section 305.4.4.4 regarding drilled shaft embedment through new embankments.
When placing drilled shafts through new embankment, special considerations with respect to settlement, downdrag, additional loading effects, and resistance of the shaft may be necessary. Plan notes are available in BDM Section 600 for construction constraints regarding drilled shaft installation and embankment construction.
305.5 75BMICROPILES C305.5
<em>Consult with the Office of Geotechnical Engineering before considering micropiles. Design micropiles in accordance with LRFD 10.9. The resistance factor for geotechnical axial resistance shall be as specified in BDM Table 305-1 for micropiles installed according to Section 33 of the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Construction Specifications.</em>
Only consider micropiles as a structure foundation (after acceptance of the Office of Geotechnical Engineering) in order to address a design constraint which would make installation of a different foundation type impractical or not cost effective. Examples may include: locations where difficult access or limited headroom preclude use of other deep foundation systems; when underpinning or retrofitting existing foundations; or at locations where foundations must bridge over or penetrate subsurface voids.
Micropiles are limited in the amount of bearing resistance they can develop by several factors:
A. Their small diameter results in a low surface area for side resistance.
B. Tip resistance is typically neglected due to the small end area.
C. Elastic compression of micropiles limits the effective bonded length to approximately 50-ft. Beyond this, there is no load transfer from the micropile to the surrounding foundation materials.
Refer to BDM Section 201.2.1.3 for information to include in the Structure Foundation Exploration Report.
Specify the number of verification tests and show the test locations in the plans. Select the number of tests by dividing the site into zones where subsurface conditions are relatively uniform using engineering judgment and performing one test in each zone including at least one test per structure. Show verification test locations in the plans. Set the Verification Test Load (VTL) as the nominal axial resistance of the micropile. Specify the VTL in the plans.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-78
Specify proof tests on a minimum of five percent of the production micropiles, or a minimum of one per substructure unit. Set the Proof Test Load (PTL) as 80 percent of the nominal axial resistance of the micropile. Specify the PTL in the plans.
For micropiles used as structure foundation elements, specify an option to allow either tension or compression load tests at the preference of the construction contractor. For micropiles subject to both tension and compression loads, or micropiles used as tensile elements in slope stabilization projects, specify both tension and compression load tests. If performing both tension and compression load tests, perform the tension load test prior to the compression load test. For micropiles used as tensile elements in slope stabilization projects, specify tension load tests. Compression load tests shall conform to ASTM D1143, “Standard Test Methods for Deep Foundations Under Static Axial Compressive Load,” Procedure A: Quick Test. Tensile load tests shall conform to ASTM D3689 “Standard Test Methods for Deep Foundations Under Static Axial Tensile Load,” Procedure A: Quick Test.
When the same micropile is to be tested in both tension and compression, it is recommended that the tension test be conducted first. This will allow the pile to be reseated during compression testing in the event some net upward residual movement occurs during the tension test.
Provide the total factored load in axial compression and the side and tip resistance for each micropile in the structure general notes. For laterally loaded micropiles, also provide externally applied lateral and moment bending loads, and the maximum values of the internal shear and moment.
Include Special Provision for Micropile Load Testing in the plans.
The Special Provision for Micropile Load Testing is available from the Office of Geotechnical Engineering.
Provide a unique number designation for each micropile in the plans.
305.6 76BCONTINUOUS FLIGHT AUGER (CFA) PILES
C305.6
Design CFA piles in accordance with SS893 and BDM Section 305.4, with the exception of Sections 305.4.4.6 and 305.4.5. Use Resistance Factors for CFA Piles provided in BDM Table 305-1.
These deep foundation elements are commonly referred to as auger-cast piles, continuous flight auger (CFA) piles, augered cast-in-place (ACIP) piles, and screw piles.
The following items must be considered before deciding to use CFA piles for foundation applications:
A1. Quality control and structural integrity
B1. Verticality of the installed CFA piles C1. Subsurface geotechnical conditions
<em>D1. Use of grout versus concrete Use LRFD Eq. 10.8.3.5.4c-2 for tip resistance for CFA piles bearing on bedrock. Ignore side resistance in bedrock.</em>
<em>CFA piles usually cannot penetrate rock (no rock sockets) except for very weak rock. There is no consideration for the use of LRFD Eq. 10.8.3.5.4c-1 for tip resistance.</em>
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025

Refer to BDM Section 201.2.1.3 for information to include in the Structure Foundation Exploration Report.
Extend concrete reinforcement for CFA piles to the bottom of the pile.
Do not construct CFA piles on a batter. Use only vertical CFA piles.
Provide the total factored load in axial compression and the side and tip resistance for the CFA piles in each substructure unit in the structure general notes. For laterally loaded CFA piles, also provide externally applied lateral and moment bending loads, and the maximum values of the internal shear and moment.
Provide a unique number designation for each CFA pile in the plans.
305.7 77BFIELD VERIFICATION OF NOMINAL RESISTANCE
C305.7
Forward the reports, electronic records, calculations, and all electronic instrumentation data files from all field verification testing of nominal resistance to the Office of Geotechnical Engineering.
The Department intends to collect this data in a database, and to use this data for future calibration of State-specific resistance factors.
305.7.1 218BDYNAMIC TESTING C305.7.1
When driven friction piles are specified, for each individual structure, specify one dynamic load testing item for each pile size. If multiple Ultimate Bearing Values are required for a given pile size, specify one dynamic load testing item for each Ultimate Bearing Value.
The Department requires dynamic load testing to establish the driving criteria (i.e. blows per foot of penetration) for all friction piles. If the designer determines that dynamic load testing should be considered for point bearing piles on bedrock, consult with the Office of Geotechnical Engineering prior to including this requirement in the plans. Dynamic load testing is performed in accordance with C&amp;MS 523 and ASTM D4945, “Standard Test Method for High-Strain Dynamic Testing of Deep Foundations.” One dynamic load testing item consists of performing successful tests on two piles (which provide adequate data to provide pile driving criteria as described in C&amp;MS 523.04) and performing a signal matching analysis of the dynamic test data on one of the two piles. One restrike item consists of performing dynamic testing on two piles and performing a signal matching analysis of the dynamic test data on one of the two piles. Restrikes are a useful tool to determine if a driven pile gains or loses capacity over time.
When friction drilled shafts are specified as structure foundation elements, specify a number of high-strain dynamic tests in accordance with BDM Table 305-1 and Sections 305.4.3 and 305.7.3.
In accordance with BDM Section 305.7.3, rapid load testing is an acceptable alternative to high-strain dynamic testing.
For CFA piles, specify high-strain dynamic tests in accordance with SS893.
See Section 305.7.3 for a description of high-strain dynamic testing.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-80
Whenever setup or relaxation are realized in the design, specify restrike testing of the same piles that are dynamically load tested (specify a minimum of one restrike item for each dynamic load testing item on the structure). For a site-specific pre-construction evaluation, specify two restrike items for each dynamic load testing item (or more, if the plan note is modified to include more than two restrikes).
Whenever a static load test is specified for driven piles, also specify dynamic and restrike testing according to BDM Section 305.7.2.
305.7.2 219BSTATIC LOAD TEST C305.7.2
When driven friction piles are specified, specify a static load test when the total pile order length for an individual structure exceeds 10,000-ft for piling of the same size and Ultimate Bearing Value. Specify one subsequent static load test for each additional 10,000-ft increment of pile order length. For each static load test, specify two dynamic testing items and two restrike items.  Limit this requirement by the following criteria:
Static load testing for driven friction piles is performed in accordance with C&amp;MS 506 and ASTM D1143, “Standard Test Methods for Deep Foundations Under Static Axial Compressive Load,” Procedure A: Quick Test. See BDM Section 600 for plan note addressing the disposition of the associated dynamic load tests.
A. No more than one static load test per substructure unit.
<em>B. A maximum number of static load tests based on site variability recommendations in LRFD C10.5.5.2.3.</em>
The maximum number of static load tests could be increased for bridges of higher complexity or operational importance.
If a static load test is specified, use a resistance factor for design of driven piles in accordance with BDM Table 305-1.
<em>When large-diameter open-ended pipe piles are specified, specify a number of static load tests based on site variability recommendations in LRFD C10.5.5.2.3, or a minimum of one per structure. For each static load test, specify one dynamic testing item and one restrike item.</em>
For each of these dynamic and restrike items, perform one test on the static load test pile and perform one on one of the anchor piles.
When friction drilled shafts are specified as structure foundation elements, specify a number of static load tests in accordance with BDM Table 305-1 and Section 305.4.3.
In accordance with BDM Section 305.7.3, bi-directional load testing is an acceptable alternative to a static load test.
For micropiles, specify verification tests and proof tests in accordance with BDM Section 305.5.
Micropile verification tests and proof tests are required in place of any other axial load testing.
Do not specify static load testing for foundation elements driven to refusal on bedrock, founded on top of bedrock, or socketed into bedrock.
305.7.3 220BSPECIAL LOAD TESTS C305.7.3
Special Load Tests include the high-strain dynamic testing, bi-directional load testing, lateral load testing, and rapid load testing.
Consult with the Office of Geotechnical Engineering before specifying any special load tests.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-81
Perform the high-strain dynamic testing in accordance with ASTM D4945, “Standard Test Method for High-Strain Dynamic Testing of Deep Foundations.”
High-strain dynamic testing is typically performed on drilled foundation elements not to verify the total nominal axial resistance, but as a proof test: to prove that the installed foundation element meets the design load-deflection criteria and verify resistance adequate to support the factored load. Mobilization of the full nominal resistance would require a magnitude of displacement that would render a drilled foundation element unusable. Perform a signal matching analysis on the dynamic test data for each high-strain dynamic test. See Special Provision: High-Strain Dynamic Testing Of Drilled Shafts and SS893 for details regarding this testing on drilled shaft and CFA pile foundations, respectively. Due to cost, high-strain dynamic tests are preferred over static load tests for drilled shaft foundation elements.
Perform the bi-directional load testing in accordance with ASTM D8169, “Standard Test Methods for Deep Foundations Under Bi-Directional Static Axial Compressive Load.”
Bi-directional load testing is also commonly known as the Osterberg load cell test or the “O-Cell test.” This test is typically utilized to verify the tip and side resistance for drilled shaft foundations that are designed to support high factored loads, or for structures with high importance factors as defined in BDM Section 100, or for substructure units supported on a single drilled shaft.
Perform Lateral load testing in accordance with ASTM D3966, “Standard Test Methods for Deep Foundations Under Lateral Load.”
The deflection data gathered during the performance of the test is used in combination with a flexural strength and stiffness model of the drilled shaft to perform a reverse p-y analysis to determine the lateral loading characteristics of the site soils.
Perform rapid load testing in accordance with ASTM D7383, “Standard Test Methods for Axial Rapid Load (Compressive Force Pulse) Testing of Deep Foundations.”
Rapid load testing is also commonly known as the Statnamic test. Similar to high-strain dynamic testing, rapid load testing is typically performed on drilled foundation elements as a proof test. Reduce the data collected during the test using the unloading point method (UPM) for drilled shafts less than 80-ft in length or the segmental unloading point method (SUPM) for longer drilled shafts.

306.1.2 222BSEALING OF CONCRETE SURFACES, SUBSTRUCTURE
C306.1.2
Specifications for the sealer are defined in C&amp;MS 512. Seal concrete surfaces with a concrete sealer as follows:
The designer has the option to select a specific type of sealer, epoxy-urethane or non-epoxy. The designer also has the alternative to just use a bid item for sealer, with no preference, and allow the contractor to choose based on cost.
A. Seal the front face of abutment backwalls, from top to bridge seat, the bridge seat and the breastwall down to the groundline with an epoxy-urethane or non-epoxy sealer.
Sealing of the backwall is not required on prestressed box beam bridges because the beams are installed before the backwall is placed.
In areas where concrete surfaces have a history of graffiti vandalism, the designer may add a permanent graffiti coating meeting the requirements of S1083 on top of the epoxy-urethane or non-epoxy sealer. A plan note is available in BDM Section 602.6. The designer should limit the concrete surfaces that are treated with permanent graffiti coatings to those reachable by easy climbing and visible to the traveling public.
B. Seal the exposed surfaces of all wingwalls and retaining walls, exclusive of abutment type, that are within 30-ft of a pavement edge, with an epoxy-urethane sealer.
In accordance with C&amp;MS 516.07, the beam seats under proposed bearing locations are not sealed.
C. Seal ends and sides of piers exposed to traffic-induced deicer spray, from any direction, with either an epoxy-urethane or non-epoxy sealer. Top of pier caps need only be sealed if there is an expansion joint or the tops are subject to exposure to deicer-laden water.
D. Seal the total vertical surface of piers within 30-ft of a pavement edge with either an epoxy-urethane or non-epoxy sealer.
E. Seal the total vertical surface of piers supporting weathering steel superstructures with either an epoxy-urethane or non-epoxy sealer
Include in the plans actual details showing the position, location and area required to be sealed. Do not use a plan note to describe the position as there can be both description and interpretation problems.

306.2 79BABUTMENTS
306.2.1 223BGENERAL C306.2.1
Abutments should be provided with backwalls to protect the superstructure from contact with the approach fill and to assist in preventing water from reaching the bridge seat.
For members designed to retain earth embankments and restrained from deflecting freely at their tops, determine the backfill pressure by using at-rest pressure.
Examples include rigid frame bridges, abutment walls keyed to the superstructure, and some types of U-abutments.
The earth pressure to be used will vary between at-rest and passive depending on the amount of movement into the backfill. See BDM Section 306.2.2.6 for information on how to determine the appropriate earth pressure.
Batter the front face of wall type abutments 1/16-in for each foot of abutment height. Measure height from bottom of footing to the roadway surface
Battering the front face is to allow for slight tilting of wall type abutments after the backfill has been placed.
306.2.1.1 415B EARING SEAT WIDTH C306.2.1.1
Numerous variables influence the abutment seat width. Refer to the applicable bridge standard drawing for bridge seat width requirements for the given superstructure and substructure combination.
For abutment bearing seat width requirements for prestressed box beams refer to BDM Figure 306-7 and Figure 306-8.
<em>Abutment seat widths shall meet the requirements of LRFD 4.7.4.4.</em>
AASHTO seismic seat width requirements, based on length and height of structure, may require additional seat width. All defined abutment bearing seat widths can be affected due to special considerations for a specific structure or type of bearing. See BDM Section 303.1.4.
306.2.1.2 416B EARING SEAT REINFORCEMENT
C306.2.1.2
Provide supplementary reinforcement in the beam seat when the cover above the main seat reinforcement exceeds 4-in within the level portion of the beam seat
Supplementary reinforcement is used to resist local compressive and shearing stresses in the beam seat.

Figure 306-4
Choose the location and spacing of all reinforcing in bridge seats so that adequate clearance is provided for bearing anchors whether cast-in or drilled-in place.
It should be noted that drilled-in place anchors use larger holes than the actual anchor and will require additional clearance.
Place a note on the substructure detail sheets cautioning the contractor to place the reinforcing to avoid interference with the anchor bolts. Also, provide a “Bearing Anchor Plan” to adequately show the location of the bearing anchors with respect to the main reinforcing bars and the edges of the bridge seats.
306.2.1.3 417BPHASED CONSTRUCTION JOINTS C306.2.1.3
Seal the vertical joint between construction phases on the back side of abutment backwalls and breastwalls from the top of the footing to the approach slab seat with ITEM 512, TYPE 2 WATERPROOFING, 3-ft wide centered on the joint.
306.2.1.4 418BEARTH BENCHES &amp; SLOPES C306.2.1.4
Do not provide a rectangular or trapezoidal shaped bench in the soil as seen in the Plan View in front of the abutment face.
This makes the structure unnecessarily long. The Department will permit a triangular shaped bench formed where a level top of slope intersects at the nearest face of the abutment
Spill thru slopes shall be 2:1, except where soil analysis or existing slopes dictates flatter slopes. Measure the slope normal to the face of the abutment.
During scoping of the project consider right-of-way limits, wingwall lengths, future maintenance issues, and overall bridge aesthetics and if altering the slope from 2:1 may be beneficial.
For superelevated bridges over waterways, the intersection of the top of slope with the face of abutment shall be on a level line.
For other superelevated structures the top of slope should generally be made approximately parallel to the bridge seat.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-88
For structures over streets and roads having steep grades, the intersection of earth slope and face of abutment may be either level or sloping dependent upon which method fits local conditions and gives the most economical and aesthetically pleasing structure.
The spill-thru slope shall intersect the face of abutment a minimum of one foot, or as specified in a standard bridge drawing, below the bridge seat for stringer type bridges. For concrete slab and prestressed box beam bridges this distance shall be 1.5-ft.
306.2.2 224BTYPES OF ABUTMENTS C306.2.2
Preference should be given to the use of spill-thru type abutments.
For stub abutments with spread footing on soil, refer to BDM Figure 305-2 for footing elevations.
Integral and semi-integral designs should be used where possible, see BDM Sections 306.2.2.5 and 306.2.2.6 respectively for additional information.
306.2.2.1 419BFULL HEIGHT ABUTMENTS C306.2.2.1
In addition to the requirements in the ODOT Aesthetic Design Guidelines adhere to the following when considering an aesthetic treatment:
A. Do not use aesthetic treatments when they will not be visible to the public.
B. Meet minimum cover requirements for concrete reinforcement. Do not violate minimum concrete cover over patterns or indents of the formliner where a formliner is used. This will require additional concrete and, in some cases, dimensional changes.
C. Specify generic formliner patterns. List an alternative available from at least three suppliers. The Department will not accept the listing of a formliner pattern available only from one supplier.
When aesthetic treatments are being considered the following criteria should be followed:
A. The selected pattern of formliner should be easily visible from a distance. Small or ornate patterns not easily visible from a distance do not enhance the structure and are not cost effective.
B. The cost of formliners selected should add only minimal additional cost to the overall cost of the concrete (1 to 3 percent per yard of the abutment, pier or wall)
306.2.2.1.a 527BCOUNTERFORTS FOR FULL HEIGHT ABUTMENTS
C306.2.2.1.a
For full height abutments exceeding 30-ft in height, the use of counterforts begins to become economical and should be investigated.
Place concrete reinforcement in the back, sloping, face of the counterfort in two rows with a 6-in clearance between rows. Stagger concrete reinforcement splices a minimum of 3-ft, by row.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-89
Stagger splices for reinforcing extending from the footing of a counterforted wall into the highly reinforced areas of the counterforts.
In counterforted walls, provide drainage at each pocket formed by the intersection of the counterfort and wall.
306.2.2.1.b 528BSEALING STRIP FOR FULL HEIGHT ABUTMENTS
Use an impervious fabric across the expansion joints in full height abutments or retaining walls to eliminate leakage. The impervious fabric shall be C&amp;MS 512 Type 2 Waterproofing, 3-ft wide, centered over, and extending the full length of the joint to the top of the footing. See BDM Section 306.2.5 on requirements for expansion joints in abutments.
306.2.2.2 420BABUTMENTS SUPPORTED ON MSE WALLS
C306.2.2.2
When conditions are appropriate, the use of MSE walls to shorten bridge spans and eliminate embankment slopes is acceptable.
Refer to BDM Section 201.2.1.3.f for the staged review requirements for MSE walls.
For a stub abutment supported on an MSE wall, support the abutment on deep foundations regardless of the proximity of bedrock below the MSE wall leveling pad. The Department will not permit the use of spread footing supported abutments on MSE walls. Piles shall have a minimum 15-ft embedment below the MSE wall. If rock exists within the minimum embedment depth, place the piles in pre-bored holes that extend a minimum of 5-ft into bedrock. Backfill the pre-bored holes with Class QC Misc. concrete up to the top of the leveling pad elevation after pile installation.
Spread footing supported abutments on MSE walls are susceptible to loss of bearing caused by erosion during the service life of the structure
306.2.2.3 421BSTUB ABUTMENTS C306.2.2.3
If a stub abutment is to support a bridge having provision for relative movement between the superstructure and the abutment, at least two rows of piles are required.
The front row piles may be battered to resist lateral loads. However, refer BDM Section 305.3.5.8 regarding the use of battered piles.
For phased construction projects, do not design an abutment phase supported on less than three (3) piles or two (2) drilled shafts.
Where multiple rows of piles are used, the piles shall align in both directions.
Where two rows of piles are used, place the rear piles directly behind alternate front piles.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-90
306.2.2.4 422BCAPPED PILE ABUTMENTS C306.2.2.4
Use one row of vertical piles for integral capped pile abutments.
Show the construction joint at the top of the footing for cap pile abutments as optional.
For phased construction projects, do not design an abutment phase supported on less than three (3) piles or two (2) drilled shafts.
<em>Support capped pile abutments on at least 5 piles. Refer to LRFD 10.5.5.2.3 for more information</em>
This requirement is to avoid non-redundant designs.
306.2.2.5 423BINTEGRAL ABUTMENTS C306.2.2.5
Integral construction involves attaching the superstructure and substructure (abutment) together. The longitudinal movements are accommodated by the flexibility of the abutments (capped pile abutment on single row of piles regardless of pile type). The superstructure may be structural steel, cast-in-place concrete, prestressed concrete I-beams or prestressed concrete box beams.
Integral design should be considered where practical.
Do not use integral design at sites where there are concerns about settlement or differential settlement
Do not use integral design with curved primary members or primary members that have bend points in any stringer line (dog-legged).
Standard Bridge Drawing ICD-1-20 shows details for integral abutments with a steel beam or girder superstructure and BDM Figure 306-5 shows the bridge length limits for ICD-1-20. Standard Bridge Drawing ICD-2-18 shows details for integral abutments with a prestressed concrete I-beam superstructure and BDM Figure 306-6 shows the bridge length limits for ICD-2-18. The length limitations defined for integral prestressed I-beam bridges corresponds to the same superstructure movement demand for steel bridges with a maximum length of 400’, considering a temperature change of 150° F for steel bridges and 80° F for concrete bridges, and a shrinkage coefficient of 0.0002 in/in for concrete bridges.
Refer to BDM Figure 306-7 for details for an integral abutment with a prestressed box beam superstructure. The bridge length limits for composite prestressed box beam bridges are the same as a prestressed concrete I-beam bridges.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-91
If the design is outside of the constraints of the standard bridge drawing or bridge design data sheets, then an alternate abutment type should be chosen, or the integral design shall be designed to account for the given circumstances. The design shall consider important variables such as, structure length, skew, lateral earth pressure and fixity of the foundation and connecting elements.
Assume the expansion length, at the abutment, is two-thirds (2/3) of the total length of the structure.
Use expansion bearings at all piers for new structures. Design the pier expansion bearings proportionally (by distance) to the assumption that the 2/3 movement could occur at one of the abutments.
Do not use cantilevered or turn-back wingwalls with integral abutments.
For an integral design to work properly, the geometry of the approach slab, the design of the wingwalls, (see BDM Section 306.2.4) and the transition to concrete bridge railings must be compatible with the freedom required for the integral (beams, deck, backwall, wingwalls and approach slab) connection to rotate and translate longitudinally. When this connection is not permitted to rotate or translate longitudinally an axial force will be induced onto the superstructure from the passive earth pressures that has not been accounted for in the design.
Support integral abutments on a single row of parallel piles. If an integral abutment design uses steel H-piles, orient the piles so the webs are parallel to the centerline of bearing.
For phased construction projects, do not design an abutment phase to be supported on less than three (3) piles.
Detail a closure section in the integral diaphragm between sections of staged construction to allow for dead load rotation of the main beams or girders.
Seal the horizontal and vertical joints at the back face of the backwall by use of a 3-ft wide sheet of nylon reinforced neoprene sheeting. Attach the sheeting on only one side of the joint to allow for the anticipated movement of the integral section. For more information refer to C&amp;MS 516.

306.2.2.6 424BSEMI-INTEGRAL ABUTMENTS C306.2.2.6
Contrary to integral construction, semi-integral construction has no structural connection between the superstructure and the substructure. This design allows the superstructure and the approach slab to move together independent of the abutment. The longitudinal movements are absorbed between the end of the approach slab and the roadway. For details at the end of the approach slab refer the BDM Section 310.2 and standard bridge drawings AS-1-15 and AS-2-15. The superstructure may be structural steel, prestressed concrete I-beams or prestressed concrete box beams.
Semi-integral design should be considered and is preferred to abutments with a deck joint.
This design should be used for uncurved (straight beams) structures.
Do not attach wingwalls to the superstructure. The vertical joints between the wingwalls and the superstructure shall be parallel with the centerline of the roadway. Fill the joints between superstructure and wingwalls with 2-in preformed expansion joint filler material, per C&amp;MS 705.03.
Generally, there are no skew limitations when using a semi-integral design. Refer to standard bridge drawing SICD-1-21 for additional details for semi-integral abutment designs for steel structures. Use BDM Figure 306-5 for the bridge length limits for SICD-1-21. Refer to standard bridge drawing PSID-1-13 for additional details for semi-integral abutment designs for prestressed concrete I-beam structures. Use BDM Figure 306-6 for the bridge length limits for prestressed concrete I-beam structures. See BDM Figure 306-8 for semi-integral details for prestressed box beam structures.

Figure 306-8
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-96
Do not use semi-integral design with a single row of piles.
The foundation for these designs must be stable and fixed in position for the design to function as intended.
Semi-integral details can be used on wall type abutments, spill-thru type abutments on two or more rows of piles, abutments on drilled shaft, or abutments with a spread footing may be appropriate for semi-integral abutments.
Do not use semi-integral designs at sites where there are concerns about settlement or differential settlement.
Assume the expansion length, at the abutment, is two-thirds (2/3) of the total length of the structure regardless of structural rigidity.
Always use expansion bearings for the abutment bearings. Design the pier expansion bearings proportionally (by distance) to the assumption that the 2/3 movement could occur at one of the abutments.
All pier bearings should be expansion bearings.
If unsymmetrical spans (from a thermal neutral point viewpoint) are used, either all pier bearings are to be expansion or piers with fixed bearings are to be designed for the forces induced by unbalanced thermal movements.
The use of a fixed pier does not allow an increase in bridge length nor does it reduce the 2/3 movement assumption.
If a fixed pier is used and the abutment diaphragm is subject to lateral earth pressures, consider the axial loads induced in the beams from the earth pressures in the pier design.
Fill the horizontal joint in the backwall created between the expansion section of the semi-integral abutment (diaphragm) and the beam seat with expanded polystyrene sheet or some equal material to act as form work for the placement of the semi-integral diaphragm concrete.
Seal both the horizontal and vertical joints at the back face of the backwall with a 3-ft wide sheet of nylon reinforced neoprene sheeting. Attach the sheeting on only one side of the joint to allow for the anticipated movement of the integral section. For more information refer to C&amp;MS 516.
For phased construction projects, do not design an abutment phase to be supported on less than three (3) piles or two (2) drilled shafts.
For phase constructed semi-integral designs, detail a closure section in the diaphragm between stages of construction to allow for dead load rotation of the main beams or girders.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-97
When a semi-integral superstructure expands, earth pressures are generated on the back face of each diaphragm. These earth pressures act perpendicular to the diaphragm, and a skewed abutment will create an eccentricity about the center of the bridge. Without proper restraint, the bridge will rotate causing localized points of high stress at wingwalls and increased stresses in cross-frames, flanges, webs and bearings (See BDM Figure 306-9).
Figure 306-9
For all semi-integral superstructures regardless of skew angle, place at least one diaphragm guide for each abutment as shown in the Standard Bridge Drawing, SICD-2-14. For structures constructed in phases, construct the guide in the first phase of diaphragm construction.
The Department may consider alternative sources of restraint in lieu of diaphragm guides during the normal staged review process.
The amount of thermal movement, the height of the diaphragm, the length of the diaphragm, the amount of skew and soil data may warrant the need for an additional diaphragm guide at each abutment. A simple force analysis of a bridge superstructure with equivalent Resultant Horizontal Earth Loads (EH) at each abutment yields the following design loads on one diaphragm guide at each abutment:
DG⊥ = γEH [Sin (θ)]
DG|| = 0.2 γEH [Sin (θ)]
Where:
DG⊥ = Primary factored load acting on    Diaphragm Guide in a direction    perpendicular to the longitudinal    axis of the bridge.
DG|| = Factored load acting on Diaphragm   Guide in a direction parallel to the    longitudinal axis of the bridge.
γ = Load factor, LRFD Table 3.4.1-1
θ = Skew angle
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-98
<em>Depending upon the amount of thermal movement, the earth pressure acting on each diaphragm could be as little as the at-rest earth pressure or as much as passive earth pressure. As noted in LRFD C3.11.5.4, the movement required to mobilize full passive pressure is five percent of the height on which the passive pressure acts. When determining the earth pressure and its load factor, linear interpolation between at-rest and full passive pressure based on the amount of movement necessary to mobilize full passive pressure is acceptable.</em>
Design Data Sheet, SICDD-2-14, provides designers detailing guidance for diaphragm reinforcement around the diaphragm guide
<em>Designing the Diaphragm Guides for a seismic horizontal connection force in accordance with LRFD 3.10.9.2 is not required.</em>
Install Diaphragm Guides on existing abutments being converted to semi-integral abutments as noted above. If the amount of abutment work will not accommodate the installation of the cast-in-place Diaphragm Guide reinforcement shown in SICD-2-14, install the reinforcement in accordance with BDM Section 406.1. Fully detail the retrofit Diaphragm Guide in the plans, and show pay ITEM 511 SEMI-INTEGRAL DIAPHRAGM GUIDE as “As Per Plan”.
When all of the bridge bearings are expansion bearings, consider providing temporary fixity before the backfill is placed behind both abutment diaphragms. Sliding plate bearings especially those with PTFE surfaces have shown a tendency to allow the superstructure to move during construction.
306.2.2.6.a 529BSEMI-INTEGRAL ABUTMENTS WITH REINFORCED EMBANKMENT
C306.2.2.6.a
In order to utilize semi-integral abutment details with reinforced embankment on a new structure with horizontally curved alignment, similar to what is shown in BDM Figure 404-6, satisfy ALL of the following criteria:
If the bridge does not meet the requirements listed, you may consult the Office of Structural Engineering to determine if semi-integral abutment details with reinforced embankment is an appropriate option on the structure.
<em>1. Structure is dog-legged OR the curvature effects may be ignored in accordance to AASHTO 4.6.1.2.4b.</em></li>
<li>The design utilizes a fixed pier. Contact OSE for details on using these details on curved single span structures.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-99</li>
<li>The superstructure shall also have an expansion length not greater than 265-ft. Determine the expansion length according to BDM Section 309.6.3.
For structures that are not horizontally curved, semi-integral abutment details with reinforced embankment may be utilized on new structures that meet the requirements of BDM Section 306.2.2.6.
Do not specify diaphragm guides (SICD-2-14) when utilizing a semi-integral abutment with reinforced embankment.
Diaphragm guides are used to counteract non-uniform soil pressure on the backface of the semi-integral abutment diaphragm. This is not necessary when reinforced embankment is being used.
306.2.3 225BABUTMENT DRAINAGE
306.2.3.1 425B ACKWALL DRAINAGE
306.2.3.1.a 530BPOROUS BACKFILL C306.2.3.1.a
For walls that will experience applied earth pressures exceeding active pressure, provide porous backfill immediately behind abutments and retaining walls according to C&amp;MS 518. Drain the porous backfill using a corrosion resistant pipe system into which water can percolate. See BDM Section 306.2.3.3 for possible exceptions.
Use porous backfill to provide drainage behind semi-integral and integral diaphragms.
Wrap porous backfill with geotextile fabric per C&amp;MS 712.09, Type A. Cover the vertical and bottom interface between the porous backfill and the excavation with the geotextile fabric. Include a 6-in vertical up turn between the porous backfill and the back face of the abutment. Extend the porous backfill excavation to the horizontal plane of the subgrade or 1-ft below the embankment surface. Extend the porous backfill to the bottom of the abutment footing except when the vertical backface of the abutment footing extends more than 1-ft out from the vertical backface of the abutment backwall. In this case, extend the porous backfill to the top of the abutment footing.  Place the porous backfill so that it is 2-ft thick for its full height behind the abutment and wingwalls except where the vertical backface of the abutment footing extends out 1-ft or less.
Place a corrugated plastic pipe drainage system at the bottom of the porous backfill and slope pipe a minimum of 1% to allow drainage. Specify corrugated plastic pipe per C&amp;MS 518 in the plans.
While galvanized corrugated pipe was used for years, the inertness and life expectancy of smooth internal wall plastic corrugated pipe makes this the better material to specify.
Use standard corrugated plastic pipe segments, tees and elbows (either 90-degree or adjustable) for the pipe drainage system design. Connect pipe segments with overlapping bands. Install end caps at the ends of runs, unless intended to function as outlets.
While a single outlet for the pipe drainage systems in the porous backfill can be adequate, the designer should evaluate whether the length of the drainage run requires multiple outlets to supply the porous backfill with a positive drainage system.

C306.2.3.1.b
For walls that will not experience applied earth pressure exceeding active pressure, provide drainage for the retained earth using a Prefabricated Geocomposite Drainage (PGD) system in accordance with C&amp;MS 518. Place PGD strips to provide continuous coverage over the back face of the wall. Provide a detail in the Plans showing the bottom of the PGD terminating at least 6-in into a minimum 1-ft wide section of Porous Backfill with Geotextile Fabric in accordance with C&amp;MS 518. Provide collection pipes and pipe outlets in accordance with BDM Section 306.2.3.1.a to ensure positive drainage of the Porous Backfill.
Do not use PGD to provide drainage behind semi-integral or integral diaphragms.

306.2.3.3 427BWEEP HOLES C306.2.3.3
Positive drainage with a pipe system in porous backfill or a drainage board system are preferred.
If a location demands the use of weep holes, place the weep holes through abutments and/or retaining walls 6-in to 12-in above the higher of OHWM or ground line. Show the porous backfill with geotextile fabric behind the walls to extend at least 6-in below the bottom of the weep holes.
Do not use weep hole type drainage systems with concrete slope protection
The flow from the weep holes undermines the concrete protection, ultimately causing its failure.
Where sidewalks are located immediately adjacent to wall type abutments or retaining walls, weep holes are not permitted. Instead use one of the options discussed in BDM Section 306.2.3.1.
306.2.4 226BWINGWALLS
Design wingwalls to have sufficient length to prevent the roadway embankment from encroaching on the stream channel or clear opening. The maximum slope of the fill behind the wingwall is 1 vertical to 2 horizontal, and compute wingwall lengths on this basis.
306.2.5 227BEXPANSION &amp; CONTRACTION JOINTS
C306.2.5
Do not place an expansion joint in an abutment breastwall beneath the superstructure. When the total length of wingwalls and breastwall exceeds 90-ft in length, place vertical expansion joints just beyond the limits the superstructure.
Expansion joints are required only when the total length of wingwalls and breastwall exceeds 90-ft.
Fill expansion joints with preformed expansion joint material, C&amp;MS 705.03.
Provide waterproofing for the expansion joints as described in BDM Section 306.2.2.1.b.
Detail concrete reinforcement so it does not project through expansion joints.
Do not use contraction joints on abutments or wingwalls.

During phased construction of a capped pile pier, do not design a pier phase to be supported on less than three (3) piles. For cap and column piers, do not design a phase to be supported on less than two (2) columns.
For a new or replacement structure, the Department will not permit individual free-standing columns without a cap.
In the design of piers which are readily visible to the public, appearance should be given consideration if it does not add appreciably to the cost of the pier. Refer to ODOT’s Aesthetic Design Guidelines for additional information.
306.3.2 229BFOOTING WIDTH C306.3.2
Where piling is used to support a free-standing pier, the minimum distance between centers of outside piles, measured across the footing, is one-fifth the height of the pier.
A “free-standing” pier is defined as one that does not depend upon its attachment to the superstructure for its ability to resist horizontal loads or forces.
The minimum width of footing supported by a drilled shaft is the diameter of the shaft plus 6-in.
The minimum width of a spread footing for a free-standing pier is one-fourth the height of the pier where founded on soil and one-fifth the height of the pier where founded on bedrock.
306.3.3 230BTYPES OF PIERS C306.3.3
For waterway bridges use one of the following pier types:
A. Capped Pile Pier
B. Cap-and-Column Pier C. Solid Wall or T-type Pier
Note the use of T-type piers, or other pier types with large overhangs, makes the removal of debris at the pier face difficult to perform from the bridge deck. For low stream crossings with debris flow problems and where access to the piers from the stream is limited, T-type piers, or other similar pier types, should not be used.
For bridges over railroads, use one of the following pier types:
A. T-type Pier B. Solid Wall Pier
C. Cap-and-Column Pier
Preference should be given to T-type piers.
306.3.3.1 428BCAP &amp; COLUMN PIERS C306.3.3.1
For highway grade separations, the preferred pier type is cap-and-column.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-104
When designing the cantilever portions of cap and column piers, calculate the design moments at the actual centerline of the column.
For grade separation structure, support cap-and-column piers within 30-ft of the edge of pavement on a minimum of three (3) columns.
The purpose for this provision is to reduce the potential for total pier failure in the event of an impact involving a large vehicle or its cargo. This requirement only applies to the final pier configuration. Piers being phase constructed may be temporarily supported on less than three (3) columns.
Select cap dimensions that meet strength requirements and provide necessary bridge seat widths according to BDM Section 303.1.4.1.a.
Typically, the pier cap ends should be cantilevered and have squared ends. Caps should be cantilevered beyond the face of the end column to provide approximately balanced factored dead load moments in the cap. The end of the cantilevered caps should be formed perpendicular to the longitudinal centerline of the cap to allow for uniform development lengths for the concrete reinforcement. Cantilevered pier caps may have the bottom surface of the cantilever sloped upward from the column toward the end of the cap. Cantilevered caps may be eliminated for waterway crossing where debris removal access is an issue.
The minimum column diameter is 36-in. Round columns are the preferred cross-section.
<em>Design columns as compression members according to LRFD 5.6.4 and 5.11. The requirements of LRFD 5.6.4.6 for minimum spiral reinforcement are not required. Design spiral and tie reinforcement using LRFD Eqn. 5.11.4.1.4-1.</em>
Continuous spiral reinforcement is preferred over circular ties.
Refer to BDM Section 310.6 for crash wall requirements.
306.3.3.1.a 532BCAP &amp; COLUMN PIERS ON PILES
For piers supported on piles, place a separate footing under each column with a minimum of 4 piles per footing.
For grade separation structures, place the top of the pier&#39;s footings a minimum of 1-ft below the level of the bottom of the adjacent ditch. This applies even when the pier is located in a raised earth median barrier.
306.3.3.1.b 533BCAP &amp; COLUMN PIERS ON DRILLED SHAFTS
C306.3.3.1.b
Where columns are supported on a drilled shaft foundation, construct the drilled shaft at least 6-in larger in diameter than the column.
This is to allow for field location tolerances of the drilled shaft.
Locate the diameter change between the column and drilled shaft foundation 1-ft below ground level or 1-ft above the OHWM.

Where cap-and-column piers are supported by spread footings on existing soils or on embankment fill, construct a continuous footing the extends beyond the center of the end column a minimum of 1/3 of the distance between the end column and the adjacent column.
This is done to provide approximately balanced moments in the footing.
Where cap-and-column piers are supported by spread footings on bedrock, construct a separate footing under each column.
For grade separation structures, locate the top of pier footings in accordance with BDM Section 305.2.1.2.a. Do not place the bottom of the footing in existing soil or on embankment fill above the frost line.
Refer to BDM Section 305.2.1.2.a for additional information on the frost line.
Build the footing for a free-standing pier with a minimum width equal to one-fourth the height of the pier where founded on soil and one-fifth the height of the pier where founded on bedrock.
306.3.3.2 429BCAPPED PILE PIERS C306.3.3.2
Steel H-piles shall be a minimum HP12x53. Show the piles on the plans with the flanges of the H-section perpendicular to the face of the pier cap.
For the determination of unsupported length, include the embedded depth to pile fixity and, if applicable, the scour depths
Capped pile type piers should be limited to an unsupported pile length of 20-ft.
See BDM Section 305.3.5.3 for piling protection requirements and BDM Section 606.4 for a plan note to be added to design drawings when the Capped Pile Pier Standard Bridge Drawing is not referenced.
Place piles not less than 9-in from the edge of the concrete pier cap, measured along the length of the pier.
Design the exposed portions of cast-in-place reinforced concrete piles with a 16-in minimum diameter. If 16-in cast-in-place reinforced concrete piles are utilized, use the following reinforcing cage:
A1. #4 spiral, with a 12-in pitch and 12-in outside diameter
B1. 8 – #6 bars equally spaced around the interior circumference of the spiral reinforcing.
If a larger pile size is required, use the following reinforcing cage:
The use of cast-in-place piles greater than 16-in in diameter will require an increase in the width of the cap of Standard Bridge Drawing CPP-1-08.

A2. #4 spiral with a 12-in pitch and an outside diameter that provides a minimum of 1.5-in of clear cover from the inside of the pipe pile
B2. Use the larger of 1% of the cross-sectional area of concrete or 8 – #6 bars for the longitudinal steel.
Extend the reinforcing cage from the finished top of the pile to 15-ft below the assumed point of fixity. Extend the cage a minimum of 15-ft below the ground level. Show the concrete reinforcement in the structure&#39;s reinforcing bar list and include in Item 507 for payment.
Provide pile protection for exposed H-piles and unreinforced concrete cast-in-place pipe piles.
Refer to the description in Standard Bridge Drawing CPP-1-08. A plan note is also available. Also See BDM Section 606.4 for a description of pile protection.
For pile embedment requirements into concrete, see BDM Section 305.3.5.1.
Show an optional construction joint at the top of pier caps for reinforced concrete slab bridges.
This joint is optional as some machine finishing equipment for slab bridge decks require a uniform depth of freshly placed concrete in order to obtain best results.
For phased construction projects, do not design a pier to be supported on less than three (3) piles.
<em>Support capped pile piers on at least 5 piles. Refer to LRFD 10.5.5.2.3 for more information.</em>
This provision is to avoid non-redundant designs.
Design the connection between the pile cap and the superstructure for the horizontal connection force specified in BDM Section 303.1.4.1.b. When using Standard Bridge Drawing, CPP-1-08, verify the spacing of the P501 bars to resist this force.
No additional seismic analysis for capped pile piers is required.
306.3.3.3 430BT-TYPE PIERS C306.3.3.3
In the cap of a T-type pier, place the top layer of reinforcing bars the full length of the cap and provide hooks at the face for development. Extend the second layer of concrete reinforcement into the stem of the pier at least the necessary development length plus the depth of the cantilever at its connection to the stem. Provide cap widths sufficient for bearing seat width according to BDM Section 303.1.4.1.a.
<em>Design stems of T-type piers and wall type piers as compression members according to LRFD 5.6.4.</em>
Wall type piers are characterized by the absence of clearly defined cap member.
<em>Provide lateral ties according to LRFD 5.10.4.3. For bridges located in areas where 0.10 ≤ SD1 &lt; 0.15, meet the requirements of LRFD 5.11.4.1.4 and 5.11.4.1.5 for the transverse steel at the top and bottom of concrete compression members.</em>

Pier caps on piles, drilled shafts or on columns are normally a minimum of 3-ft wide. While normally adequate, verify that bearing seat widths of 3-ft are adequate. Large bearings, skew angle, intermediate expansion devices, AASHTO earthquake seat requirements, etc. may require additional width.
Design the pier bearing seat width for reinforced concrete slab bridges according to Standard Bridge Drawing CPP-1-08.
306.3.5 232BPOST-TENSIONED CONCRETE PIER CAPS
C306.3.5
Where vertical clearance or geometric considerations require stringers to be continuous through and/or in the same plane as the pier cap, a post-tensioned concrete cap should be investigated as a first option in lieu of a steel pier cap. However, this is a non-redundant design, and, as specified in BDM Section 1001.2, these structure types require a concurrent detail design review to be performed by the Office of Structural Engineering.
306.3.6 233BSTEEL CAP PIERS C306.3.6
If at all possible this alternative should not be selected. This is a fracture critical design that has historically shown both steel member and weld metal cracking problems. As specified in BDM Section 1001.2, these structure types require a concurrent detail design review to be performed by the Office of Structural Engineering.
If a steel box girder is required as a pier cap, provide access to the interior.
The physical dimensions of the box need to be large enough to allow access to the interior for inspection, maintenance, and repair. The access hole should be a minimum of 24-in wide and 40-in tall.
Incorporate an access hatch at all access points. Bolt and seal access hatches with a neoprene gasket.
Access hatches should be hinged on the side with a latch, handle and lock. It is recommended to have a vented hatch.
Ensure that all governmental agency regulations regarding enclosed spaces, ventilation, lighting, etc. are complied with within any enclosed steel pier cap design.
The Department will not permit box designs with cut away webs to allow for stringers to continue through the box.
Situations that require stringers to be continuous through, and in the same plane with a steel pier cap or crossbeam should be avoided if possible.
Review all weld details for possible fatigue problems

<em>Unless protected from collision by an adequate fendering system, design piers in the navigation channel of waterways, to resist collision forces based on AASHTO Guide Specification for Vessel Collision Design of Highway Bridges.</em>
306.3.8 235BPIER CAP STIRRUP REINFORCEMENT
Detail stirrups for concrete beams of constant depth, such as pier caps, using either 2 “U” bars with the vertical legs long enough to furnish the required lap length or a single bar closed type stirrup with 135-degree bends at both ends of the rebar. Only select the single bar closed type stirrup when minimum required lap lengths cannot be provided with the “U” type stirrup. Place the corner with the 135-degree bends of the closed type stirrup in the compression zone of the concrete beam.

306.4.1 236BGENERAL C306.4.1
When laminated elastomeric bearings are not used, provide justification, including design calculations showing why elastomeric bearings will not be adequate for the structure.
The Department’s policy is to use laminated elastomeric bearings whenever possible. If additional load capacity and/or movement is required, consider using a high load multi rotational (HLMR) Bearing
306.4.2 237B EARING TYPES
306.4.2.1 431BELASTOMERIC BEARINGS C306.4.2.1
Design elastomeric bearings to withstand load, expansion and rotation.
Refer to BDM Section 1014.8 for additional design requirements.
Design elastomeric bearings based on a selected durometer of either 50 or 60.
Non-laminated elastomeric bearings are acceptable only if actual design calculations support their use.
Design the laminated elastomeric bearings to fit the specific structure.
Elastomeric bearings should be limited to a 5-in maximum elastomeric height excluding internal laminates with a minimum total height of 1-in.
The minimum laminate thickness shall be 12 gage (0.1046-in).
In July 2022, the minimum laminate thickness specified in C&amp;MS 711.23 increased from 14 gage (0.0747-in) to 12 gage in order to stiffen the laminates making them less susceptible to warping during fabrication.
Except for prestressed box beam superstructures, install a steel load plate on elastomeric bearings.
Bearing for prestressed box beams may also need load plates. See Standard Bridge Drawing BD-1-11 for more information.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-109
Control the field welding on the elastomeric bearing load plate so that the temperature of the elastomer does not exceed 300°F.
<em>Bevel the elastomeric bearing assembly if the rotation and or grade exceed the limitations of LRFD Section 14. If the elastomeric bearing assembly has a load plate and a column section, bevel the column. If the elastomeric bearing assembly only has a steel load plate, bevel the load plate. If the load plate is beveled, make smallest thickness of the load plate the design thickness.</em>
The column section is typically an HP shape. This assembly is used with semi-integral and integral abutment types.
It is considerably more expensive to bevel the steel load plate than the column section. For this reason, the column should be beveled if applicable. A nominal minimum thickness of 1.5-in is recommended but not mandatory.
Do not bear elastomeric bearings on unbonded steel surfaces. Vulcanize all steel plates in contact with an elastomeric bearing to the bearing.
Compensate for vertical deformations of the bearings greater than 1/8-in by adjusting the elevations of the bridge bearing seats. Place a note in the design plans.
Include the unfactored dead load, live load (without impact) and total load reactions for each elastomeric bearing design in the plans.
When the decks of twin structures without elastomeric bearings are being tied together resulting in a total structure width in excess of 60-ft, replace the existing bearings with elastomeric bearings.
Refer to Bridge Standard Drawing PSID-1-13 for standard expansion bearing details for prestressed I-beam superstructures.
For box beam bridges, place two elastomeric bearing pads at each end of each beam. Design the bearing for the required movement and rotation. At least 1-in minimum thickness is required.
Assume a fixed bearing condition to be obtained by the use of 1-in thick laminated elastomeric bearing pads and the installation of anchor dowels with grout.
On skewed box beam bridges, provide a 1/8-in thick preformed bearing shim material, C&amp;MS 711.21, the same plan dimensions as the bearing, to accommodate any non-parallelism between bottom of beam and bridge seat. Include the preformed bearing pads in an item 516 in the Estimated Quantities.
This non-parallelism between bottom of beam and bridge seat can result from camber and beam warpage due to skew and fabrication. Generally, half as many preformed bearing pads should be specified as the number of bearings.
306.4.2.2 432BHIGH LOAD MULTI ROTATIONAL (HLMR) BEARINGS
C306.4.2.2
Where high load multi rotational (HLMR) bearings are required, provide the bearings per SS869.
HLMR bearings are capable of sustaining high vertical loads and multi-directional rotations. Included with PTFE (Teflon) sliding surfaces, HLMR bearings are capable of large expansion movements.
HLMR bearings are not considered proprietary and, therefore, alternate bearing designs are not required.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-110
AASHTO has both a design and construction section for HLMR bearings. Use both publications and this Manual as a guide in designing, selecting and specifying an HLMR bearing.
For HLMR bearings, provide a plan note that requires the contractor to coordinate the substructure bearing seat elevations or dimensions with the selected bearing manufacturer.
A note is available in BDM Section 702.14.
If requested, provide the Department justification for the use of HLMR bearings. Include in the justification calculations showing why elastomeric bearings without sliding surfaces will not be adequate for the structure.
Elastomeric bearings with sliding surfaces are not economically superior to disc bearings and should not be considered.
Show the design requirements for both vertical and horizontal loads, required movements, required rotations and maximum friction factor for the sliding surfaces in the plans. Clearly specify design requirements as factored/unfactored.
To accommodate the required horizontal movements, these types of bearings utilizes PTFE (Teflon) to stainless steel sliding surfaces. The design should consider that the Teflon to stainless steel friction factors vary with the applied load (i.e. the lower the load, the higher the friction factor).
In the plans, require that the anchors for the HLMR bearings are to be set by use of a steel template with a minimum thickness of 1/4-in.
The minimum vertical load on a pot bearing shall not be less than 20% of total vertical design load.
306.4.3 238BGUIDELINES FOR FIXED ELASTOMERIC BEARINGS
C306.4.3
Assume a fixed bearing condition to be obtained by the use of 1-in thick laminated elastomeric bearing pads and the installation of anchor dowels with grout
For additional information, see BDM Section 306.4.2.1 on elastomeric bearings.
306.5 82BSLOPE PROTECTION C306.5
For structures of the spill-thru type where pedestrian traffic adjacent to the toe of the slope is anticipated or the structure is located in an urban area within an incorporated city limit, pave the slope under the structure with concrete slope protection per C&amp;MS 601.07. Provide slope protection to all areas under freeway bridges over city streets not covered by pavement or sidewalk. Check drainage discharge from the bridge to ensure that discharge is not crossing sidewalks, etc.
Drainage discharge that crosses sidewalks can cause ice, dirt and debris to build-up.
On spill-thru slopes under grade separation structures, areas that are not protected by concrete slope protection, protect the slope with crushed aggregate material as provided in C&amp;MS 601.06.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-111
The slope protection, either concrete or rock, shall extend from the face of the abutment down to the toe of the slope and shall extend in width to 3-ft beyond the outer edges of the superstructure. At the acute corners of a skewed bridge, intersect the outside edge of the slope protection with the actual or projected face of the abutment 3-ft beyond the outer edge of the superstructure and extend down the slope, normal to the face of the abutment, to the toe of the slope. Toe in the base of the slope protection.
Note that the natural vegetation on the slopes when shaded by a new structure will die out. For this case consider placing additional slope protection.
307 14BRETAINING WALLS
307.1 83BGENERAL DISCUSSION C307.1
A retaining wall is a structure that supports a differential height of earth on either side or retains earth laterally.
Refer to BDM Section 201.1.2.5 for information related to the Retaining Wall Justification.
<em>Design bridge abutments, wing walls, and culvert headwalls as retaining walls in accordance with BDM Section 307 and LRFD Section 11. Design wall-type piers with differential heights of fill on either side as structure foundations in accordance with LRFD Section 10, and as retaining walls, in accordance with LRFD Section 11 letting the critical conditions control the design.</em>
The Department will only accept prefabricated retaining wall systems approved through the Prefabricated Retaining Wall System Approval Process. Select an approved wall system listed on the Department’s Approved Products List. These systems include precast gravity and semigravity wall systems, prefabricated modular wall systems, and MSE wall systems, as discussed in BDM Sections 307.2, 307.3, and 0.
The Prefabricated Retaining Wall System Approval Process and associated Approved List applies to all walls supporting roadway infrastructure (a roadway, roadway embankment, or other transportation-related structure, or used as a wingwall for a bridge or culvert) or any wall greater than 3 feet in exposed height. If the wall does not meet either of these criteria, then a prefabricated retaining wall system that is not on the Approved List may be used. An example would be a less than 3-foot tall landscaping wall supporting a lawn adjacent to the roadway.
For retaining walls with cast-in-place concrete facing, provide expansion joints every 90-ft and contraction joints every 30-ft. Concrete reinforcement shall not project through expansion or contraction joints.
Place 1-in preformed expansion joint filler (PEJF), C&amp;MS 705.03, in all expansion joints.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-112
Waterproof the earth-facing side of all expansion, contraction, and phased construction joints with a 3-ft width of Type 2 Waterproofing according to C&amp;MS 512, centered over the joint and extending from the top of the footing to the top of the wall. For wall types where the earth-facing side of the cast-in-place concrete is not accessible, install a 6-in PVC CRD-C 572-74 waterstop at the center of the wall thickness, centered over the joint and extending from the top of the footing to the top of the wall.
Examples of walls where the back side of the cast-in-place concrete facing is not accessible include soldier pile and lagging walls, other drilled shaft walls, soil nail walls, and sheet pile walls with permanent cast-in-place facings.
For retaining walls with full-height architectural precast concrete facing panels, set the bottom of the panels on a continuously reinforced concrete bearing grade beam. As a minimum, provide a grouted shear key connection between the panels and the grade beam designed to resist all applied lateral loads. Provide a structural attachment at the top of the panels to the primary retaining wall members (e.g. top of a drilled shaft or soldier pile) or to a reinforced concrete load distribution slab. Do not utilize an architectural concrete coping for the top structural attachment. Design all copings to accommodate thermal movements of the panels. Provide a minimum open gap of 6-in between the precast facing panels and the retaining wall. Provide drainage at the bottom of the gap in accordance with C&amp;MS 518.
Architectural precast concrete facing panels are not a structural component of the retaining wall and are merely an aesthetic component. The concrete bearing grade beam may be a “freely floating” concrete footing bearing on the foundation soil, or may be structurally attached to the primary retaining wall members.
For cast-in-place or precast retaining wall elements, provide a 2.0-in minimum concrete cover over the concrete reinforcement except as noted below:
A. 2.5-in for surfaces exposed to air  B. 3.0-in for surfaces cast against earth
The requirement for concrete cover is greater for exposed surfaces, as these may come into contact with road salt. The 3-in concrete cover requirement for cast-in-place elements cast against earth is due to lesser quality control in the excavation and casting.
For retaining walls other than culvert headwalls and wingwalls, ensure that surface drainage for the entire contributing drainage area does not overtop the coping or face of retaining walls for the 10-year storm event. Redirect surface drainage away from the wall or provide supplemental drainage consisting of a ditch above the wall with sufficient capacity to capture the drainage without overtopping. Design the ditch and line the ditch bottom in accordance with the L&amp;D, Vol. 2, Section 1102. For specific requirements for MSE walls, see BDM Section 0. For guidance on collecting surface runoff at bridge abutments, see L&amp;D, Vol. 2, Section 1103.8.2, Erosion Control at Bridge Ends.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025

Provide drainage for the retained earth using a Prefabricated Geocomposite Drainage (PGD) system in accordance with C&amp;MS 518. Place PGD strips to provide continuous coverage over the back face of the wall. Provide a detail in the Plans showing the bottom of the PGD terminating at least 6-in into a 2-ft wide section of Porous Backfill with Geotextile Fabric in accordance with C&amp;MS 518. Provide collection pipes and pipe outlets to ensure positive drainage of the Porous Backfill.
PGD is not used for MSE walls or for most prefabricated modular walls. For specific drainage detailing requirements for MSE walls, see BDM Figure 201-2 through Figure 201-7. For prefabricated modular walls where PGD is impractical, provide granular drainage per SS870.
Use BDM Table 307-1 for retaining wall fill soil design parameters for internal and external stability. Do not use these parameters for material acceptance. Determine soil parameters for the foundation soil or bedrock materials based on the in-situ conditions encountered by the soil borings.
This guidance is for fill soils that do not exist at the time of wall design. Walls supporting existing materials should be designed to support the existing conditions. Semigravity wall infill is the material placed behind the wall stem, and above the footing heel. Prefabricated Modular Wall Infill is the material placed within the prefabricated wall modules.

<em>Use the Coulomb equation to calculate the active earth pressure coefficient (ka).</em>
Use the at-rest earth pressure coefficient to compute the lateral earth loads for retaining walls that are restrained from deflecting freely.
<em>Examples of retaining walls restrained from deflecting freely include rigid frame bridges, abutment walls keyed to the superstructure, and some types of U-abutments. Refer to LRFD C3.11.1 for magnitude of tolerable movements to reach active earth pressure.</em>
<em>Apply passive earth pressure in accordance with LRFD C3.11.1 to structural members subjected to thermal movements into retained soils.</em>
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-114
Incline the active and passive earth pressure loads on retaining walls at an angle from a perpendicular to the back face of the wall equal to the soil-structure interface angle (δ). Use the following values of δ for the following wall interfaces:
δ = ⅔ ϕ for soil-on-soil or for soil-on-cast-in-   place concrete,
δ = ½ ϕ for soil-on-precast concrete,
δ = ⅓ ϕ for soil-on-steel, and
δ = ¾ ϕ for soil-on-prefabricated modular     stepped modules, where ϕ is the internal    friction angle of the retained soil.
<em>See LRFD Figure C3.11.5.9-2 for an example of prefabricated modular stepped modules. See LRFD C3.11.5.3 and Table C3.11.5.9-1 for the source of the specified values for δ. A soil-on-soil interface is typically assumed for semigravity walls regardless of whether the wall stem is composed of cast-in-place or precast concrete.</em>
For analysis of earth pressure loading on non-gravity cantilever walls (e.g. drilled shaft walls and sheet pile walls) do not incline earth pressure loads at angle δ (assume δ = 0).
Applying vertical load components to these types of walls will tend to increase the stiffness response of the cantilever members, and is considered unconservative.
<em>In LRFD Figures 3.11.5.6-1, 3.11.5.6-4, or 3.11.5.6-5 the equations for passive earth pressure do not apply if the discrete vertical wall elements are spaced at closer than three diameters (3b). If the foundation soil is very loose to loose granular or very soft to soft cohesive material, use the passive resistance only over a width of b. See LRFD C3.11.5.6-1 for other restrictions.</em>
<em>These equations assume the passive earth pressure to be distributed over a longitudinal distance of 3b. For closer spaced discrete vertical wall elements, the load must be distributed over a longitudinal distance equal to the spacing between the discrete vertical wall elements (l). In soft or loose soils, full soil arching is assumed to not develop.</em>
<em>When designing anchored walls under traffic loadings, do not exclude live load surcharge (LS). Include LS in addition to the apparent earth pressure (AEP) calculated according to LRFD 3.11.5.7.</em>
Add additional surcharge loads and water loads to the AEP, as applicable.
<em>If a broken back-slope is present within a horizontal distance of the height (H) of the wall behind the back pressure surface of a wall, utilize the notional slope of backfill (β′) in place of the slope of the backfill surface behind the retaining wall (β) in the Coulomb equation for the calculation of the active earth pressure coefficient (ka). Continue to use β to determine the notional height of earth pressure diagram (h). See BDM Figure 307-1 (a), (b), &amp; (c) for examples of this procedure for a semigravity walls and MSE wall, or prefabricated wall, respectively. In place of this simplified approach, Generalized Limit Equilibrium (GLE) analysis and Coulomb trial wedge analysis, may also be used for determining the resultant horizontal earth pressure loading on retaining walls for “broken back” and more complex loading conditions.</em>
<em>The “simplified approach,” is described in LRFD C3.11.5.8.1 and is shown for the example of an MSE wall in LRFD Figure C3.11.5.8.1-1. Generalized Limit Equilibrium (GLE) analysis and Coulomb trial wedge analysis, are described in LRFD 3.11.5.8.1, and Appendices A11.3.1 through A11.3.3.</em>

Figure 307-1 Use Earth Surcharge (ES) for earthen surcharge loads (such as a temporary earthen surcharge for consolidation) or for additional walls or earthen structures supported above the height of the wall (such as tiered walls). For tiered wall systems, the magnitude of the ES load shall be equal to the unit weight of the backfill soil times the height of the upper wall (or walls) above the top of the lower wall, as long as the upper wall is within a horizontal distance of one-half the height (H) of the lower wall behind the back face of the lower wall.
Do not treat a wedge of soil slope at the top of a wall as an earth surcharge (ES) load with load factor γES if the wedge is located within the notional height of earth pressure diagram (h) for the wall (W2 as shown in Figure 307 1). Instead, use vertical earth pressure (EV) for this load.
The uncertainty attached to load factor γES is higher than for γEV because the mechanism of load transfer to the wall is less certain.
<em>When calculating the Live Load Surcharge (LS) according to LRFD 3.11.6.4, the minimum total unit weight of soil shall be 125-pcf.</em>
The magnitude of the Live Load Surcharge shall be 125-pcf unless there is a special loading condition, such as heavy construction equipment or railroad loading.
When factoring an inclined load into horizontal and vertical components for mathematical convenience in the calculations, do not use separate maximum and minimum load factors for the respective components of the loads. Treat each inclined load as a single load, which either serves to stabilize or destabilize the structure, then apply the same load factor (either maximum or minimum) to both the horizontal and vertical components of the load.
Inclined loads do not have actual horizontal and vertical components; these are a mathematical convenience to make the stability computations easier to calculate. If it is uncertain whether a single, inclined load will either serve to stabilize or destabilize the structure, perform the calculations both ways.
Include vehicular collision forces (CT) in foundation stability analyses in the Extreme Event II Limit State for walls with integral traffic barriers. Distribute vehicular collision forces along the length of the wall a minimum of the distance between two expansion joints.
When specifying retaining walls within the influence zone of a railroad track, consult with the applicable railroad company regarding their specific loading requirements.
For the Cooper E 80 load refer to Chapter 15, Part 1 of the AREMA Manual for Railway Engineering. A Cooper E 80 load on a single track equates to a Live Load Surcharge of an 1882-psf strip load, 8.5-ft wide.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025

Provide a crash wall as specified in the AREMA Manual for Railway Engineering for retaining walls located within 25-ft of the centerline of tracks, or other distance as specified by an individual railroad. If a retaining wall face constructed with cast-in-place or precast concrete has integral elements that meet the requirements of a crash wall, the retaining wall does not have to be protected by a separate crash wall. Prefabricated modular walls and MSE wall systems do not meet the definition of a crash wall.
Include wind-induced loads on noise barriers mounted on top of retaining walls in the design.
307.1.2 240BOVERALL STABILITY C307.1.2
<em>Analyze overall (global) stability for each retaining wall at critical locations according to LRFD 11.6.3.7, with the following exceptions:</em>
A. Do not use factored loads for the analyses. B. Use the following resistance factors for the analyses:
Factored loads are incompatible with limit equilibrium analysis.
Design retaining walls that support other structures for overall stability using a resistance factor of φ = 0.65.
Design retaining walls that do not support other structures for overall stability using a resistance factor of φ = 0.75.
Resistance factors as shown in LRFD 11.6.2.3 should be taken as the inverse of the following factors of safety (FS) for the case of limit equilibrium slope stability analysis only:
φ = 0.75 corresponds to FS = 1.3
φ = 0.65 corresponds to FS = 1.5 When considering overall stability of a tiered wall system, analyze the stability of the tiered wall system collectively, and each tier separately.
307.1.3 241BRESISTANCE TO HORIZONTAL FORCES
<em>For retaining wall types listed in BDM Section 307.2 through 0 and 307.7.2, perform a check for sliding resistance according to LRFD 10.6.3.4. If the sliding resistance of the foundation material is inadequate to withstand the horizontal forces:</em>
A. For retaining wall types listed in BDM Section 307.2, see BDM Section 305.2.1.3.
B. For retaining wall types listed in BDM Section 307.3 and 307.7.2, increase the foundation width or depth, or specify internal fill with a higher unit weight.
C. For retaining wall types listed in BDM Section 0, increase the soil reinforcement length.

<em>Do not utilize passive resistance against sliding unless the wall penetrates below frost depth or soil disturbance. See LRFD 11.6.3.5.</em>
The opposite is also the case: passive resistance can be used if the wall penetrates below frost depth or probable soil disturbance.
For Reinforced Soil Slopes, refer to publications Geotechnical Engineering Circular 11 (GEC 11) Design and Construction of Mechanically Stabilized Earth Walls and Reinforced Soil Slopes, Vol. I (FHWA-NHI-10-024) and II (FHWA-NHI-10-025) and SS863.

For retaining wall types listed in BDM Section 307.6 and 307.7.1, or for deep foundation elements, perform either:
A. A p-y analysis at the Strength Limit State, checking that the vertical element does not have infinite or incalculable deflection
It is acceptable for the Strength Limit State analysis deflection to be quite large, as long as the Service Limit State analysis deflection meets the required serviceability limits.
<em>B. A moment equilibrium analysis about the tip of the vertical elements using LRFD Figures 3.11.5.6-1 through 3.11.5.6-7 with Strength Limit State Load Factors and Resistance Factors, in accordance with the commentary in LRFD C11.8.4.1.</em>
For the determination of Service Limit State deflections using this method, it will be necessary to perform multiple integrations of the loading diagram, using the assumed stiffness, EI, of the vertical element.

<em>For retaining wall types listed in BDM Sections 307.2 through 0 and 307.7.2, perform a check for bearing resistance in accordance with LRFD 10.6.3.1 or LRFD 10.6.3.2, as applicable. See BDM Section 305.2 for additional guidance on bearing resistance analysis of shallow foundations.</em>
For Reinforced Soil Slopes, refer to publications Geotechnical Engineering Circular 11 (GEC 11) Design and Construction of Mechanically Stabilized Earth Walls and Reinforced Soil Slopes, Vol. I (FHWA-NHI-10-024) and II (FHWA-NHI-10-025) and SS863.
For retaining wall types listed in BDM Sections 307.6 and 307.7.1, do not check bearing resistance unless the wall is being used to support a structure (e.g. as a bridge abutment).

307.1.6 244BVERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL MOVEMENTS
C307.1.6
Limit total settlements to the serviceability requirements of the infrastructure supported by the wall. Evaluate settlement limits in the post construction condition.
Strength Limit State effects of settlement can properly be evaluated as soon as the affected structural element is constructed. Service Limit State effects should be evaluated post construction of the structure.
Consider differential settlements for walls in the longitudinal direction.
Limit differential settlements for rigid gravity and semigravity walls, precast concrete panel walls, and all other walls with full-height concrete facings (whether cast-in-place or precast) to 1/500.
This limit will minimize cracking of the concrete.
Limit differential settlements for prefabricated modular walls or modular block walls to 1/200.
Regardless of the size of facing elements, limit differential settlements for MSE walls to 1/100 without slip joints, and to 1/50 with slip joints. If differential settlements will exceed 1/50 or with total settlement of 6-in or more, design a two-stage wall system in accordance with BDM Section 307.4.1 or design a remediation to limit the settlement.
Limit differential settlements for gabion walls, Reinforced Soil Slopes (RSS), temporary walls, or for walls with facings applied after wall settlement has completed to 1/50.
For anchored walls, account for the relaxation or elongation of the anchors (and resultant unloading or loading of the anchors) due to settlement of the soil material behind the wall face or settlement of the vertical wall elements.
Relaxation and unloading of anchors may result in unacceptable lateral deflection of the anchored wall face.
Additional limitations on total and differential settlement for retaining walls supporting bridge superstructures are provided in BDM Section 305.1.3. For settlement effects on bridge superstructures and settlement remediation, refer to BDM Section 305.1.3.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025

The Service Limit State horizontal deflection limit for all retaining walls is one percent (1%) of the retained height (H) of the wall.
Additional limits may control depending on other elements supported by or located behind the wall. For retaining walls that support bridge structures, superstructure movements shall not be impeded by horizontal deflection of the retaining structure.
307.1.7 245BSEISMIC DESIGN C307.1.7
A retaining wall does not need to be designed for seismic effects unless it supports a structure which is required to be designed for seismic loading.
This is according to LRFD 11.5.4.2.
For seismic design of retaining wall foundations, see Section 305.1.5.
307.2 84BRIGID GRAVITY AND SEMIGRAVITY WALLS
C307.2
<em>Design rigid gravity and semigravity walls in accordance with LRFD 11.6.</em>
Refer to LRFD Figure C11.6.1.1-1 for a graphical illustration of types of rigid gravity and semigravity walls.
Concrete used in rigid gravity and semigravity walls shall conform to Item 499, Class QC 1. Concrete reinforcement shall conform to C&amp;MS 509.02. Unless otherwise noted in the Scope of Services, all concrete reinforcement used in a cast-in-place concrete element shall be epoxy coated.
The minimum wall stem thickness shall be 10-in. The minimum thickness shall be 1.5-ft at the top of the stem when concrete bridge railings are cast directly on top of a retaining wall.
Refer to BDM Section 305.2.1.2 for minimum footing depth requirements.
Some traffic barrier shapes can support a differential height of earth on either side; traffic barriers used in this way are rigid gravity walls. Do not perform a stability analysis for standard traffic barrier Type C or C1 supporting a differential height of earth of 2-ft or less. If traffic barrier rigid gravity walls are bearing on pavement layers (including the aggregate base course) then do not embed the barrier further into the ground unless required for foundation stability analyses. Do not key traffic barrier rigid gravity walls bearing directly on bedrock that are found to have adequate resistance in foundation stability analyses, and the base of the wall is a minimum of 2-ft below the proposed ground surface, including pavement.
For deep foundation supported walls, analyze the external stability of the foundations according to BDM Section 305. Design other elements of the retaining wall in accordance with BDM Section 307.

307.2.1 246BRIGID GRAVITY WALLS C307.2.1
Reinforced and unreinforced cast-in-place concrete rigid gravity walls are acceptable.
Unreinforced rigid gravity walls are often referred to as “concrete mass gravity walls.”
307.2.2 247BCANTILEVER WALLS C307.2.2
<em>For full height abutments and semigravity walls greater than 15-ft in height (H), batter the front face 1/16 in/ft of height of the wall stem. Refer to LRFD Figure 11.6.3.2-1 for a definition of (H). For semi-integral abutments, measure the height to the beam seat for this purpose.</em>
The specified batter allows for slight tilting of the wall after the backfill has been placed, in order to achieve an active earth pressure condition. For U-shaped structures, or in cases where considerable horizontal curvature increases the stability of a retaining wall, the front face shall be vertical.
307.2.3 248BCOUNTERFORT WALLS C307.2.3
Provide counterforts for full height abutments and semigravity walls exceeding 30-ft in height (H).
Counterforts may be used on shorter walls if found to be economically and structurally efficient.
Place concrete reinforcement in the back, sloping, face of the counterfort in two rows with a 6-in clearance between rows. Stagger the location of reinforcement splices of each row by a minimum of 3-ft. Do not post-tension counterforts.
This makes the minimum width of a counterfort 10-in plus the width of the two rows of concrete reinforcement. Refer to BDM Section 307.1 for minimum cover requirements in walls.
Stagger splices of reinforcement extending from the footing of a counterfort wall into the highly reinforced areas of the counterforts.
Provide drainage in each pocket formed by the intersection of the counterfort and wall stem.
Drainage may be detailed to run around or through the counterforts.
307.2.4 249BPRECAST GRAVITY AND SEMIGRAVITY WALLS
C307.2.4
The Department will approve all precast gravity and semigravity wall systems through the Prefabricated Retaining Wall System Approval Process. Select a wall system listed on the Department’s Approved Products List. Precast gravity and semigravity walls shall be rigid gravity, cantilever, or counterfort types, in accordance with the respective BDM Sections 307.2.1, 307.2.2, and 307.2.3.
These walls are often built with precast upright elements (stem and counterforts) but with cast-in-place footings; however, precast footings may also be used.
If the wall includes a precast footing, place a bed of grout under the footing (between the foundation soil and the footing). If the wall does not include a precast footing, construct a cast-in-place footing, and place grout bedding between the cast-in-place footing and the bottom of the precast wall units. Specify the grout bedding as a minimum one inch thick. Grout shall conform to C&amp;MS 510.02.
The bed of grout is to ensure an intimate contact on the bottom of the precast units and prevent rocking or differential settlement due to uneven contact with the ground.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-121
Unless otherwise noted in the Scope of Services, all concrete reinforcement used in a precast concrete element shall be epoxy coated. The interface between two precast elements, where concrete reinforcement extends across the interface, shall be completely filled with non-shrink mortar meeting the requirements C&amp;MS 705.22.
307.3 85BPREFABRICATED MODULAR WALLS
C307.3
<em>Design prefabricated modular walls in accordance with LRFD 11.11 and SS870. Do not use walls of these types as bridge abutments or as bridge substructures. If precast concrete wall elements are reinforced, all concrete reinforcement shall conform to C&amp;MS 509.02, and shall be epoxy coated steel reinforcement. Concrete cover shall be in accordance with BDM Section 307.1. The interface between two precast elements, where concrete reinforcement extends across the interface, shall be completely filled with non-shrink grout meeting the requirements C&amp;MS 705.21.</em>
These walls typically consist of square or rectangular prefabricated modular units. These units are stacked vertically at the face, stacked vertically with a setback (an effective batter), or placed battered.
The Department will approve all prefabricated modular wall systems through the Prefabricated Retaining Wall System Approval Process. Select a wall system listed on the Department’s Approved Products List.
The Department will not include modular wall systems with dry-cast units in the Approved Products List. Refer to BDM Section 307.3.1 for restrictions to the use of modular block walls with dry-cast units.
Foundation preparation shall consist of excavation to below the wall base elevation, and placement and compaction of a minimum 12-in of granular material leveling pad according to C&amp;MS 203.07. If the foundation of the wall requires more excavation, then increase the quantity of wall excavation and specify one of the following suitable materials: Modular Wall Infill according to SS870.03.C; ITEM 203 GRANULAR EMBANKMENT; ITEM 203 GRANULAR MATERIAL TYPE B; or ITEM 203 GRANULAR MATERIAL TYPE C. Show the deeper excavation limits on the plans; include ITEM 203 – GRANULAR EMBANKMENT, AS PER PLAN; and a plan note permitting any of the four material types listed above. The granular material leveling pad shall extend over the entire wall foundation area, and 12-in horizontally in front of the wall face.
The thickness of the granular material leveling pad may be increased according to the requirements of the proprietary wall system manufacturer, or based on design necessity to remove unsuitable soils, provide increased bearing resistance, or reduce settlement.
For walls founded on bedrock, the foundation preparation may be eliminated.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-122
<em>Determine sliding resistance of prefabricated modular wall foundations both at the top and bottom of the granular material leveling pad. If the wall uses a concrete leveling pad over a granular material leveling pad, determine sliding both at the top of the concrete leveling pad and at the bottom of the granular material leveling pad. Use a sliding resistance factor of φτ = 1.00 in accordance with LRFD Table 11.5.7-1 for gravity walls. Determine bearing resistance of prefabricated modular wall foundations at the bottom of the granular material leveling pad. Use a bearing resistance factor of φb = 0.55 in accordance with LRFD Table 11.5.7-1 for gravity walls.</em>
<em>ODOT takes exception to the provisions of LRFD Table 11.5.7-1 that state Article 10.5 applies for these checks. Prefabricated modular walls are not dissimilar to gravity walls with respect to external stability, and the use of lower resistance factors specified in Article 10.5 unnecessarily penalizes prefabricated modular walls. The resistance factors in LRFD Table 10.5.5.2.2-1 are appropriate for bridge pier footings and are calibrated to previous practice factors of safety. The reason that the resistance factors in this table are in general less than for walls is due to the lower load factors specified in LRFD Table 3.4.1-2 for the most significant sources of loading carried from a bridge superstructure.</em>
If the proprietary wall system calls for a concrete leveling pad or for a prefabricated modular wall with a total wall height (H) greater than 6-ft, design and construct a concrete leveling pad on top of the granular material according to SS870.06.D.
The minimum vertical distance from a point of the ground surface within 4-ft from the face of the wall to the top of the granular material leveling pad (or to the bottom of the concrete leveling pad, if provided) shall be 2-ft, defined as the foundation embedment. The design height of the wall (H) includes this foundation embedment as shown in BDM Figure 307-2. Measure the notional height of earth pressure diagram (h) from the lowest point at the heel of the wall foundation to the point where an imaginary line on the back face of the wall intersects the backfill slope above the wall, as shown in BDM Figure 307-2.

Where the alignment of prefabricated modular walls changes, use curves or corners with an interior angle of at least 90 degrees.
The alignment of prefabricated modular walls should be straight and with as few corners or curves as is practical.
<em>Check the stability of prefabricated modular walls at every module level according to LRFD 11.11.4.1. This includes overall stability, resistance to horizontal forces / sliding, and limiting eccentricity / overturning resistance. Also check the individual modules for structural resistance against earth pressure, according to LRFD 11.11.5.1.</em>
307.3.1 250BMODULAR BLOCK WALLS C307.3.1
Modular block walls are made up of segmental concrete masonry units (blocks) of precast concrete (either dry-cast or wet-cast) laid in a running bond “brick” pattern, dry stacked (without mortar), in level courses (or layers) of blocks.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-124
Modular Block Walls are also commonly known as Segmental Retaining Walls (SRW), Modular Segmental Retaining Walls, and Modular Concrete Block Retaining Walls.
Design and construct geosynthetic reinforced modular block walls as MSE walls with block facings in accordance with BDM Section 307.4 and SS840.
Modular block walls may be designed as free-standing gravity walls depending upon the design and detailing requirements of the wall manufacturer/supplier.
Do not use dry-cast block walls to support a roadway, roadway embankment, or other transportation-related structure, or as a wingwall for a bridge or culvert.
Road salt and freeze-thaw cycle conditions have been shown to cause deterioration in dry-cast concrete, and severely limiting service life.
307.3.2 251B IN WALLS C307.3.2
Design bin walls in accordance with the requirements of SS870.
A bin wall is generally a Metal Cellular Wall. However, some bin walls are made up of precast concrete bin units.
307.3.3 252BCRIB WALLS C307.3.3
Design crib walls in accordance with the requirements of SS870.
A crib wall is a Concrete Cellular Wall.
Do not use timber crib walls for highway applications.
307.3.4 253BGABION WALLS C307.3.4
Gabion baskets used for walls shall have a minimum dimension of 36-in in all directions. Cover the back face of a gabion wall with Geotextile Fabric, Type A as a filter fabric between the retained soil and the gabions. Gabions shall meet the requirements of SS838.
Gabion walls are composed of prefabricated metal baskets of welded or twisted wire mesh, backfilled with stone.
307.4 86BMSE WALLS C307.4
The Department will approve all MSE wall systems through the Prefabricated Retaining Wall System Approval Process. Select a wall system listed on the Department’s Approved Products List.
For MSE wall submittal requirements refer to BDM Section 201.4.1.
<em>Design MSE walls in accordance with this section, LRFD 11.10 and SS840. The proprietary wall companies will be responsible for designing the internal stability of the wall in accordance with the project plans and SS840.</em>
SS840 defines the requirements for construction and design for internal stability for Mechanically Stabilized Earth (MSE) walls.
Design MSE walls in accordance with the following requirements:
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-125
A. See BDM Figure 307-1(b) and GDM Section 1504 for a definition of how to measure the notional height of the back pressure surface of an MSE wall (h). See SS840.04.A.2 for a definition of how to measure the wall height (H) for payment quantities. The soil reinforcement length shall not be less than 70 percent of the wall height (H) or 8-ft, whichever is greater. Only increase this minimum soil reinforcement length as necessary to meet external stability requirements: bearing resistance, sliding resistance, limiting eccentricity (overturning), and overall (global) stability.
B. The minimum vertical distance from the top of the leveling pad to any point on the ground surface within 4-ft of the face of the wall shall be 3-ft. Refer to BDM Figure 201-4 for more information. This location defines the Maximum Leveling Pad Elevation. Provide the Maximum Leveling Pad Elevation in the Plans along the wall alignment.
C. The minimum step increment between leveling pad elevations is 1.25-ft, or one-quarter of a typical panel height. The maximum step between leveling pad elevations is 2.50-ft.
Typical wall panels are approximately 5-ft tall and the wall fabricators need the steps to be no less than one-quarter of their standard wall panel height. The more conservative step height would be 2.50-ft, which potentially overestimates select granular backfill quantity. Step heights less than 1.25-ft may lead to quantity underestimation for the select granular backfill.
D. To calculate the estimated quantity for the Select Granular Backfill, refer to SS840 – Method of Measurement
E. For Reinforced Soil and Retained Soil parameters, use SS840 Table 840.04-1 in the design of MSE walls for internal and external stability. Determine soil parameters for the foundation soils based on the soils encountered by the soil borings.
F. Foundation preparation shall consist of excavation to below the leveling pad elevation, and placement and compaction of a minimum of 12-in of Granular Material Type C according to the requirements of C&amp;MS 204.07. If the foundation of the wall requires more excavation, then show the deeper excavation limits on the plans and include an “As per plan” item for Foundation Preparation. The foundation preparation shall extend over the entire wall foundation area, and 12-in horizontally in front of the leveling pad.
The thickness of Type C may be increased according to the requirements of the proprietary wall system manufacturer, or based on design necessity to remove unsuitable soils, provide increased bearing resistance, or reduce settlement. For walls founded on bedrock, the foundation preparation may be eliminated.
G. Where the alignment of permanent MSE walls changes, use curves or corners with an interior angle of at least 90 degrees. For temporary MSE walls utilized for maintenance of traffic, do not use corners with interior angles of less than 45 degrees.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-126
H. Abutments on MSE walls shall be supported on piles regardless of the proximity of bedrock to the MSE wall foundation. See BDM Section 305.3.5.7 for minimum pile embedment below the MSE wall. Abutment piles through MSE walls shall be vertical.
I. For MSE walls containing abutments on piles: 1. The minimum distance between the back face
of the MSE wall panels and the toe of the bridge abutment pile cap shall be 1-ft.</li>
<li>The minimum distance between the back face of the MSE wall panels and the centerline of the closest row of piles shall be 3.5-ft.
For wire-faced MSE walls (temporary or permanent) or two-stage MSE walls, this minimum distance is measured to the back of the vertical face of the wire baskets. This offset is only necessary in the longitudinal direction of the bridge and is not required in the transverse direction for turn-back wingwalls or phase-line temporary walls.</li>
<li>The minimum distance between the centerlines of adjacent rows of piles shall be 3.5-ft.
This provision allows for compaction of the fill between the pile sleeves.
J. Do not place an integral abutment within an MSE wall.
The Department will allow the use of Semi-integral abutment designs within an MSE wall.
K. All MSE soil reinforcements shall be connected to facing elements. The Department will not allow field cutting of MSE soil reinforcements to avoid piles or other obstacles.
Consider the ramifications of this provision when detailing the pile layout and the design of the abutments and/or wing walls.
Do not place ITEM 204 GEOTEXTILE at the base of the Granular Material Type C foundation preparation for MSE walls.
Geotextile fabric would reduce sliding resistance of the wall foundation.
Collect surface drainage before it reaches the face of the MSE wall. On structures with MSE walls at the abutments, provide a concrete bridge railing on the approach slab with a standard inlet, SCD I-3D to collect the drainage. Locate the inlet at least 25-ft beyond the limits of the MSE wall soil reinforcement. Continue the concrete barrier 10-ft past the catch basin. Refer to BDM Figure 309-30 for more information.
Control of drainage is especially critical at MSE walls. MSE walls depend upon the integrity of the reinforced fill material for the stability of the wall. Infiltration of surface runoff into the wall can compromise the reinforced fill material by erosion or piping.
Determine sliding resistance and bearing resistance of MSE wall foundations both at the top and bottom of the foundation preparation layer.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025

307.4.1 254BTWO-STAGE MSE WALLS C307.4.1
<em>Design wire-faced MSE walls in accordance with LRFD 11.10 and SS867. The proprietary wall companies will be responsible for designing the internal stability of the wall in accordance with the project plans and SS867. All metal components of the wire-faced MSE wall shall be galvanized according to SS867.03.A.</em>
This wall type consists of a wire-faced MSE wall, with permanent precast concrete facing panels applied post-construction to the wall. The precast panels can be either full-height, which are set on a concrete bearing grade beam and attached to a load distribution slab at the top of the wall, or can be conventional MSE wall panels, which are set on a leveling pad and individually attached to the wire-faced wall. The space between the full-height panels and the wire-faced wall can be left open or filled with MSE wall select granular fill; for walls with conventional MSE wall panels, the space must be filled with MSE wall select granular fill.
The typical sequence of construction involves construction of the temporary wire-faced MSE wall, a waiting period for settlement, and then attachment of the precast concrete panel facing.
SS867 defines the requirements for construction and design for internal stability for wire-faced MSE walls.
307.4.2 255BGRS-IBS ABUTMENTS C307.4.2
See publications FHWA-HRT-11-026 and FHWA-HRT-11-027 for details of the system and a design methodology for GRS-IBS.
GRS-IBS stands for Geosynthetic Reinforced Soil Integrated Bridge System.
Do not use GRS-IBS to support bridges on Interstate, U.S. Federal Route, or State Route highways. Do not use GRS-IBS with dry-cast block wall facing elements.
307.5 87BREINFORCED SOIL SLOPES C307.5
Design Reinforced Soil Slope (RSS) systems in accordance with publications FHWA-NHI-10-024 and FHWA-NHI-10-025, Geotechnical Engineering Circular 11 (GEC 11); and SS863.
An RSS may be used to increase the steepness of a highway embankment slope, where a retaining wall might otherwise be used to avoid right-of-way or other impacts
Do not use RSS systems on spill-thru slope in front of abutments for water crossings.
Refer to BDM Section 404.6 for an acceptable application of RSS placed beneath an approach slab in combination with semi-integral abutments.
307.6 88BDRILLED SHAFT WALLS C307.6
<em>Design drilled shaft walls in accordance with LRFD 11.8.</em>
<em>The following definitions apply throughout BDM Section 307.6 and to LRFD 3.11.5.6 and LRFD Figures 3.11.5.6-1 through 3.11.5.6-7:</em>
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-128
b = Drilled Shaft Diameter (width of a discrete    vertical wall element)
l = Drilled Shaft Center-to-center Spacing (center-to-center spacing of vertical wall elements)
D = Foundation Depth (depth of drilled shaft embedment below design grade)
H = Design Retained Height (height of the wall above design grade)
L = Length of discrete vertical wall elements  = D + H
l/b = Spacing-to-diameter ratio D/L = Embedment-to-length ratio
<em>Measure the design retained height (H) of drilled shaft walls from the top of the retained earth to the design grade, according to LRFD Figures 3.11.5.6-1 through 3.11.5.6-7. Service Limit State deflection criteria and p-y analyses control the drilled shaft embedment in accordance with BDM Sections 305.1.2 and 307.1.6. The minimum embedment (D) for drilled shaft walls founded entirely in soil shall be equal to the retained height (H) such that the embedment-to-length ratio (D/L) shall not be less than 0.5.</em>
The design grade is typically taken as either the frost penetration depth, the depth to pavement subgrade located in front of the wall, or the assumed depth of future utility excavations which may occur immediately in front of the wall.
<em>For drilled shaft walls with a cast-in-place concrete facing, provide a structural attachment between the facing and the exposed face of the discrete vertical wall elements. For drilled shaft walls with full-height precast concrete facing panels, see the requirements of BDM Section 307.1. For drilled shaft walls with a spacing-to-diameter ratio (l/b) greater than one, and for all soldier pile walls, design the facing to resist the lateral earth pressure.</em>
Typically, the attachment of the cast-in-place concrete facing is made with embedded dowels for drilled shafts and welded shear studs for soldier piles.
For structural design of drilled shaft walls, in the Strength Limit State, check both the factored flexural resistance and factored shear resistance versus the maximum factored moment and shear in the discrete vertical wall elements. In the Service Limit State, check horizontal deflection at the top of the discrete vertical wall elements. Achieving fixity at the tip (bottom) of the discrete vertical wall elements is not required, provided the serviceability deflection limit is met at the top; see BDM Section 307.1.6 for details on serviceability deflection limits.
Do not analyze drilled shaft walls with the “Geotechnical Strength Limit State” analysis, specified in publication FHWA-NHI-10-016, Geotechnical Engineering Circular 10 (GEC 10) “Drilled Shafts: Construction Procedures and LRFD Design Methods,” Section 12.3.3.3.1.
The “Geotechnical Strength Limit State” analysis is intended for analyses of bridge structure foundations and is not intended for retaining walls.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-129
When performing a p-y analysis for a drilled shaft wall, do not analyze the discrete vertical wall elements by cutting them off at the bottom of the retained height, and applying a resultant shear, moment, and axial load at the foundation elevation. Analyze the discrete vertical wall elements by using the theoretical distributed load over the entire retained height to determine the reactions above the foundation elevation.
While “cutting off” the vertical wall elements may be sufficient for analyzing reactions below the foundation elevation, and produces realistic shear and moment distributions below the cut-off point, it does not include the shear and moment above the cut-off point and it does not adequately account for the deflection at the head of the vertical wall elements (the top of the wall).
For drilled shaft walls with an embedded steel section (typically a W-section) within a reinforcing bar cage, use composite behavior when analyzing for the shear and flexural resistance of the discrete vertical wall elements (the drilled shafts). For drilled shaft walls with an embedded steel section, and without a reinforcing bar cage, use the non-composite section (steel only) properties for the shear and flexural resistance of the discrete vertical wall elements. Assume the steel section to be continuously braced where it is embedded in the drilled shaft concrete.
Consideration may be given to embedding a steel section inside the reinforcing bar cage of a drilled shaft wall to increase flexural resistance and stiffness, decrease the amount of steel in the cage, and potentially decrease the size of the drilled shafts.
See BDM Section 305.4.4.2 regarding the minimum concrete cover over concrete reinforcement for drilled shafts. For drilled shaft walls with an embedded steel section, the minimum concrete cover over concrete reinforcement also applies to the embedded steel section. When the vertical wall elements of drilled shaft walls contain both an embedded steel section and a reinforcing bar cage, the minimum clearance between the embedded steel section and the inside of the reinforcing bar cage shall be three times the maximum aggregate size.
Do not specify weathering steel for the vertical elements of a soldier pile and lagging wall or for a drilled shaft embedded steel section. Specify ASTM A709 Grade 50 steel.
When calculating axial load from self-weight of a drilled shaft, for the portion below the design grade, offset the weight of the drilled shaft concrete with the total unit weight of the replaced soil per Archimedes’ principle of buoyancy (γeffective self-weight = γconcrete – γsoil).
Typically, the effective unit weight below design grade will be approximately equal to γeffective self-weight = γconcrete – γsoil = 150 pcf – 120 pcf = 30 pcf.
<em>In LRFD Figures 3.11.5.6-1, 3.11.5.6-4, and 3.11.5.6-5, distribute the passive earth pressure resistance over a width of 3 times the width of a discrete vertical wall element (b). If the discrete vertical wall elements are placed closer together than 3 times b, replace the value of 3b with the center-to-center spacing of vertical wall elements (l) in the equations for the passive earth pressure.</em>
The zones of passive resistance for each drilled shaft discrete vertical wall element cannot overlap.
<em>In LRFD Figures 3.11.5.6-4, 3.11.5.6-5, 3.11.5.6-6, and 3.11.5.6-7, if γsH &lt; 2Su, use a value of zero (0) for the active earth pressure in the portion of the wall below the retained height (Pa2).</em>
The active earth pressure in the portion of the wall below the retained height (Pa2) could result in a negative value if γsH - 2Su &lt; 0; however, it is not possible to have a negative active earth pressure.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-130
<em>For tangent or secant drilled shaft walls that support a vertical load, calculate the axial side resistance for the group of drilled shafts by taking the perimeter of the group of drilled shafts, according to LRFD 10.7.3.9 and 10.8.3.6 and publication FHWA-NHI-10-016, Geotechnical Engineering Circular 10 (GEC 10) “Drilled Shafts: Construction Procedures and LRFD Design Methods,” Section 14.4.</em>
This condition will typically occur where a drilled shaft wall is acting as a bridge abutment. Effective individual side resistance for each drilled shaft may be determined by dividing the group side resistance by the number of drilled shafts.
For drilled shaft walls embedded into bedrock, specify a single drilled shaft diameter for the full length of each vertical wall element; do not specify the drilled hole above bedrock as 6-in larger in diameter than the rock socket.
Tangent and secant drilled shaft walls with permanent cast-in-place facing, with a drilled shaft diameter of 30-in or greater, meet the requirements of an AREMA crash wall, specified in BDM Section 307.1. A soldier pile wall does not meet the requirements of an AREMA crash wall unless it has a permanent cast-in-place facing with a thickness of 30-in or greater.
For drilled shaft walls using reinforcing bar reinforcement in the shafts, specify Thermal Integrity Profiling (TIP) testing for a number of the drilled shaft elements in accordance with Section 305.4.5. For drilled shaft walls that do not use reinforcing bar reinforcement in the shafts (e.g. containing a W or HP steel section), and for soldier pile walls, do not specify TIP testing of the drilled shafts.

C307.6.1
If the tangent drilled shaft wall has a permanent cast-in-place facing, place wall drainage between the permanent facing and the drilled shafts at the joints between the adjacent drilled shafts. Provide vertical drainage paths with a minimum width of 18-in. The vertical drainage may be composed of either free-draining granular material meeting the requirements of C&amp;MS 605.02, with a minimum thickness of 10-in measured perpendicular to the wall face, fully wrapped in Geotextile Fabric Type A; or may be composed of PGD strips. Where PGD is used, provide a detail in the Plans showing the bottom of the PGD terminating at least 6-in into a 2-ft wide section of Porous Backfill with Geotextile Fabric in accordance with C&amp;MS 518. Provide collection pipes and pipe outlets to ensure positive drainage of the Porous Backfill. Do not allow concrete from the facing to intrude into the joints between the adjacent drilled shafts.
<em>Tangent drilled shaft walls have a spacing-to-diameter ratio (l/b) approximately equal to one. The wall is composed of a series of drilled shafts constructed adjacent to each other or with a small gap (less than 6-in) between the shafts.</em>
If the wall is to have full-height precast concrete facing panels, see the requirements of BDM Section 307.1 regarding drainage.

The wall is composed of a series of reinforced primary drilled shafts, alternating and overlapping with unreinforced secondary drilled shafts. Generally, the secondary drilled shafts are constructed first, and then the primary drilled shafts are excavated through the secondary drilled shafts while the shaft concrete is still “green.” Sometimes a lower strength concrete is used for the secondary drilled shafts.</em>
Do not provide drainage for secant drilled shaft walls. Design secant drilled shaft walls to resist static pressure from ground water.
Secant drilled shaft walls are impervious and will block ground water flow. This wall type is often used specifically for ground water control.
307.6.3 258BSOLDIER PILE WALLS C307.6.3
Design lagging to resist lateral earth pressure. Walls utilizing temporary timber lagging shall have a permanent cast-in-place facing.
Soldier pile walls have a spacing-to-diameter ratio (l/b) greater than one. The gaps between the discrete vertical wall elements (soldier pile beam sections) are filled with lagging, consisting of either permanent precast concrete panels or temporary lagging timbers. Timber lagging is assumed to deteriorate in the permanent condition, therefore the permanent cast-in-place facing is designed to resist the lateral earth pressure. Walls with permanent precast lagging may use full-height precast concrete facing panels.
<em>Design precast concrete lagging panels as simply supported slabs according to LRFD Section 5. Precast concrete lagging panels shall be steel-reinforced, using epoxy-coated welded wire reinforcement conforming to C&amp;MS 709.14. Locate the center of the vertical wires at each end of the panel at a maximum 2.5-in from the end of the panel. Provide concrete cover over the concrete reinforcement in accordance with BDM Section 307.1. Precast concrete lagging panels shall have a minimum thickness of 5.5-in if a permanent cast-in-place facing is utilized, and 6-in otherwise. The minimum thickness of the permanent cast-in-place facing is 9-in. The ends of the panels shall overlap the flanges of the soldier pile beams on each end by a minimum of 1-in more than the concrete cover over the concrete reinforcement. If no other facing is added, the panels shall have a 1-in chamfer at the exposed top and bottom.</em>
In some cases where the wall does not face a roadway or public space, the wall may be designed with permanent precast lagging without a facing.
BDM Figure 307-3. details the described wall dimensions.

Figure 307-3
Design timber lagging according to LRFD Section 8 or publication FHWA-RD-75-128, “Lateral Support Systems and Underpinning,” Section 9.32. Timber lagging shall have a minimum thickness of 3-in. The ends of the lagging timbers shall overlap the flanges of the soldier pile beams on each end by a minimum of 2-in.
Provide timber blocks between individual lagging timbers. Provide elastomeric bearing pads between individual precast concrete lagging panels. The timber blocks shall be at least 3-in long, 3-in wide and 3/8-in tall. The elastomeric bearing pads shall be at least 3/8-in tall with a length and width equal to the thickness of the precast concrete lagging panels minus 1-in. Place one timber block or elastomeric bearing pad at each end of each joint between the lagging timbers or precast concrete lagging panels.
The blocks and bearing pads promote drainage between the lagging timbers or panels. In the case of precast lagging panels, the elastomeric bearing pads also protect the panels from damage during installation and overstress at the corners.
If the soldier pile beam section is embedded in a drilled shaft, the width of a discrete vertical wall element (b) shall be equal to the nominal diameter of the drilled shaft. If an embedded soldier pile beam section does not extend to the bottom of the drilled shaft, use a concrete reinforcement cage in the drilled shaft. If the soldier piles are driven rather than placed in a drilled shaft, the width of a discrete vertical wall element (b) shall be equal to the flange width of the soldier pile beam section.
If an embedded soldier pile beam section extends to the bottom of the drilled shaft, it is not necessary to use a concrete reinforcement cage in the drilled shaft; however, if a concrete reinforcement cage is used, see BDM Section 307.6 for additional considerations.

<em>Assume the portion of the soldier pile beam section below the design grade to be continuously braced. Check flexural resistance for this portion in accordance with LRFD 6.10.8.1.3.</em>
<em>Assume the portion of the soldier pile beam section above the design grade to be unbraced, with an unbraced length equal to the retained height (H). Check flexural resistance for this portion according to LRFD 6.10.8.2. Compare the factored resistance to the maximum factored moment calculated within the unbraced length.</em>
<em>If soldier pile walls do not have a permanent cast-in-place facing, design the soldier pile beams with measures to resist corrosion and deterioration, in accordance with LRFD 10.7.5 for a service life of 75 years. The corrosion protection shall extend 3-ft below the exposed portion of the beam.</em>
The requirements for corrosion protection do not apply to temporary soldier pile walls.
If the wall has a cast-in-place permanent facing, place wall drainage between the permanent facing and lagging. Provide continuous coverage over the width of the lagging, between the soldier pile beams. The vertical drainage may be composed of either free-draining granular material meeting the requirements of C&amp;MS 605.02, with a minimum thickness of 10-in measured perpendicular to the wall face, fully wrapped in Geotextile Fabric Type A; or may be composed of prefabricated geocomposite drain (PGD) strips. Where PGD is used, provide a detail in the Plans showing the bottom of the PGD terminating at least 6-in into a 2-ft wide section of Porous Backfill with Geotextile Fabric in accordance with C&amp;MS 518. Provide collection pipes and pipe outlets to ensure positive drainage of the Porous Backfill. Do not allow concrete from the facing to intrude into the joints between the lagging panels or timbers.
If the wall has full-height precast concrete facing panels, see the requirements of BDM Section 307.1 regarding drainage. Design the soldier pile beams with measures to resist corrosion and deterioration as above.

Design steel sheet pile with ASTM A572, Grade 50 steel, minimum. Specify the steel grade in the general notes. See BDM Section 602.3-1.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025

For steel sheet pile walls with a cast-in-place concrete facing, provide a structural attachment between the facing and the exposed face of the steel sheet piles. For steel sheet pile walls with full-height precast concrete facing panels, see the requirements of BDM Section 307.1.
Typically, the attachment of the cast-in-place concrete facing is made with welded shear studs.
<em>Design permanent steel sheet pile walls with measures to resist corrosion and deterioration, in accordance with LRFD 10.7.5 for a service life of 75 years. The corrosion protection shall extend 3-ft below the exposed portion of the beam.</em>
If a steel sheet pile wall has a cast-in-place permanent facing, design drainage according to C&amp;MS 518.
If the wall has full-height precast concrete facing panels, the drainage requirements of BDM Section 307.1 apply.
A steel sheet pile wall does not meet the requirements of an AREMA crash wall unless it has a permanent cast-in-place facing with a thickness of 30-in or greater.
307.7.1 260BCANTILEVER SHEET PILE WALLS
C307.7.1
<em>Design cantilever sheet pile walls in accordance with LRFD 11.8. For cantilever sheet pile walls with permanent cast-in-place facing, designate a specific steel sheet pile section or equivalent. For all other cantilever sheet pile walls, specify a minimum section modulus and moment of inertia per unit width of the sheet pile.</em>
Cantilever sheet pile walls are composed of PZ-Section elements, installed as a linear wall, perpendicular to the retained earth. The sheet pile sections in this case retain the soil in cantilever action, primarily through flexural resistance.
Cantilever sheet pile walls are designed on a per-unit-width basis of vertical face. For steel sheet pile walls with permanent cast-in-place facing, the connection details will depend on the width of the specific steel sheet pile section.
<em>The following definitions apply throughout BDM Section 307.7.1 and to LRFD 3.11.5.6 and LRFD Figures 3.11.5.6-3, 3.11.5.6-6, and 3.11.5.6-7:</em>
D= Foundation Depth (depth of steel sheet pile embedment below design grade)
H = Design Retained Height (height of the wall above design grade)
L = Length of steel sheet pile elements = D + H D/L = Embedment-to-length ratio
<em>Measure the design retained height (H) of cantilever sheet pile walls from the top of the retained earth to the design grade according to LRFD Figures 3.11.5.6-3, 3.11.5.6-6, and 3.11.5.6-7. The minimum embedment (D) for cantilever sheet pile walls shall be equal to the retained height (H) such that, the embedment-to-length</em>
The design grade is typically taken as either the frost penetration depth, the depth to pavement subgrade located in front of the wall, or the assumed depth of future utility excavations which may occur immediately in front of the wall.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-135
ratio (D/L) is not less than 0.5.
For structural design of cantilever sheet pile walls, in the Strength Limit State, check both the factored flexural resistance and factored shear resistance versus the maximum factored moment and shear per unit width of the wall. In the Service Limit State, check horizontal deflection at the top of the wall face. Achieving fixity at the tip (bottom) of the continuous vertical wall elements is not required, provided the serviceability deflection limit is met at the top; see BDM Section 307.1.6 for details on serviceability deflection limits.
When performing a p-y analysis for a cantilever sheet pile wall, do not analyze the continuous vertical wall elements by cutting them off at the bottom of the retained height, and applying a resultant shear, moment, and axial load at the foundation elevation. Analyze the continuous vertical wall elements by using the theoretical distributed load over the entire retained height to determine the reactions above the foundation elevation.
While “cutting off” the vertical wall elements may be sufficient for analyzing reactions below the foundation elevation, and produces realistic shear and moment distributions below the cut-off point, it does not include the shear and moment above the cut-off point and it does not adequately account for the deflection at the head of the vertical wall elements (the top of the wall).
In LRFD Figures 3.11.5.6-6 and 3.11.5.6-7, if γsH &lt; 2Su, use a value of zero (0) for the active earth pressure in the portion of the wall below the retained height (Pa2).
The active earth pressure in the portion of the wall below the retained height (Pa2) could result in a negative value if γsH - 2Su &lt; 0; however, it is not possible to have a negative active earth pressure.
307.7.2 261BCELLULAR SHEET PILE WALLS C307.7.2
<em>The minimum foundation embedment of cellular sheet pile walls is the larger of 3-ft or the frost depth at the front (exposed) face. It is acceptable for the steel sheet pile PS-Sections to not be embedded below the minimum foundation embedment elevation of the wall. Check the external stability of the sheet pile cells in bearing resistance, sliding resistance, and limiting eccentricity (overturning) at the foundation elevation as gravity walls in accordance with LRFD 11.6.3.</em>
Cellular sheet pile walls are composed of rectangular, circular, or semi-circular sheet pile cells with PS-Section elements, containing retained earth, which together act as a gravity wall, similar to a bin wall.
The sheet pile sections in this case do not retain the soil in cantilever action, but merely in tension across the face of the cell. Publication EM 1110-2-2503 provides a useful design reference.
<em>For closed sheet pile cells, driving the rear sheet pile sections deeper to provide uplift resistance against overturning or passive resistance against sliding is acceptable. Check resistance versus uplift according to LRFD 10.7.3.11 for a group of driven steel piles. If providing resistance to sliding, ensure that the steel sheet pile PS-Sections can resist the horizontal load in flexure and shear.</em>
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-136
<em>Check the connection in interlock tension between individual PS-Section elements versus the maximum interlock strength between the elements. For semi-circular cells (which are not closed at the back) also check pullout resistance of the cell wall versus the retained earth pressure. Assume the friction angle between the steel sheet pile and soil to be δ = 0.33 ϕ for a soil-steel interface, in accordance with LRFD C3.11.5.3. Resistance factors for the failure modes of connection interlock tension and horizontal pullout shall be as follows:</em>
A. Connection Interlock Tension: φinterlock = 0.75
B. Horizontal Pullout Resistance: φpullout = 1.00
The resistance factors for the failure modes of connection interlock tension and horizontal pullout are calibrated to ASD factors of safety for interlock tension = 2.0 and for pullout resistance = 1.5, assuming the primary LRFD factored load to be EH, horizontal earth pressure, with load factor γp = 1.50.
307.8 90BANCHORED WALLS C307.8
Design anchored walls according to LRFD 11.9, SS866, and publication FHWA-IF-99-015, Geotechnical Engineering Circular 4 (GEC 4) “Ground Anchors and Anchored Systems.” Other than exceptions given in this section, these walls shall conform to the specifications of BDM Sections 307.6 or 307.7, as applicable.
The terms “tieback anchor” and “ground anchor” are considered synonymous.
Tieback anchors are a possible solution to increase resistance to horizontal forces (sliding) for a gravity wall with spread footings, per BDM Section 305.2.1.3. Anchored walls may otherwise be of any of the non-gravity cantilever wall types listed under BDM Sections 307.6 or 307.7 (drilled shaft walls, or steel sheet pile walls), with the addition of ground anchors to limit deflection and resist overturning or structural failure of the vertical wall elements.
Anchored soldier pile walls utilizing laced-together, back-to-back MC or C channel steel sections for the discrete vertical wall elements are not preferred. Lacing two channel sections together requires a large amount of fabrication and is inefficient for weight of steel per flexural resistance for each soldier pile beam. The preferred approach is to use HP or W steel sections with shop-prefabricated “windows” for the placement of the tieback anchors.
Reference SS866 for all walls utilizing ground anchors. Specify anchor locations, anchor inclination, minimum anchor lengths, minimum unbonded lengths, Factored Design Load (FDL), and lock-off load on the Project Plans. For permanent ground anchors, specify the number of proof, performance, creep, and investigative anchor pullout tests to be performed, and specify an appropriate level of corrosion protection for the anchors. Temporary ground anchors do not require specified testing or corrosion protection.
Both proof and performance tests in SS866 are sometimes called “proof tests” in other publications; investigative anchor pullout tests are sometimes referred to as “verification tests” in other publications.
Ground anchors do not contribute to overall (global) stability unless the anchors develop their pullout resistance beyond the zone of potential soil shear failure.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-137
<em>When an anchored wall is subject to live load surcharge (LS) loading, the horizontal earth pressure load on the wall shall consist of a combination of an Apparent Earth Pressure (AEP) diagram load in accordance with LRFD 3.11.5.7 and a live load surcharge load in accordance with LRFD 3.11.6.4. For factored loading, separate these two components of load and have the appropriate load factors applied according to LRFD Tables 3.4.1-1 and 3.4.1-2.</em>
For anchored walls, a p-y analysis of the foundation is not required. Design the embedment depth below design grade of anchored non-gravity walls according to GEC 4, Section 5.5.
Overturning and serviceability lateral deflection of the foundation are not considered valid failure modes for an anchored wall.
<em>Unless the vertical wall elements are founded in bedrock, include the effect of settlement of vertical wall elements in design of anchored walls according to LRFD 11.9.3.1, and GEC 4 Sections 5.6, and 5.11.1.</em>
Settlement can cause reduction of anchor loads. There is additional risk associated in placing a bridge abutment on top of an anchored wall, as the imposition of the bridge loads after construction of the wall can cause vertical displacement and relaxation of the anchors.
307.9 91BSOIL NAIL WALLS C307.9
Design soil nail walls in accordance with LRFD 11.12.
Specify soil nail locations, soil nail inclination, minimum soil nail lengths, and Factored Design Load (FDL) on the Project Plans.

Where:
<em>γp = maximum load factor for vertical earth  pressure EV from LRFD Table 3.4.1-2  = 1.35</em>
Tmaxsn = maximum tensile force in the soil    nail (kips)
Rpo = nominal pullout resistance of the soil nail  (kips)
φpo = resistance factor for soil nail pullout  = 0.65
Specify a minimum of one verification test for each design soil nail length and design soil stratum in which the soil nails are to be installed. Show verification test locations in the plans.
The Verification Test Load (VTL) is equal to the nominal pullout resistance of the soil nail, per GEC 7 Section 9.4.3.
Specify proof tests on a minimum of five percent of the production soil nails in each row, or a minimum of one per row.
The Proof Test Load (PTL) is equal to 75 percent of the nominal pullout resistance of the soil nail, per GEC 7 Section 9.4.4.

Provide collection pipes and pipe outlets to ensure positive drainage of the Porous Backfill.
Include the Special Provision for soil nail walls in the plans.
The Special Provision for soil nail walls is available from the Office of Geotechnical Engineering.
307.10 92BTEMPORARY WALLS C307.10
Temporary walls shall have a design service life of no more than three years. If a retaining wall must serve more than three years, perform the design as for a permanent wall. Steel components of temporary walls do not require corrosion protection, including concrete reinforcement in reinforced concrete components. Otherwise, perform all aspects of the design for temporary walls the same as for permanent walls of the same type.
Temporary walls can be of the same type as any permanent retaining wall. Special retaining wall types that are only used for temporary applications include wire faced MSE walls, fabric wrapped walls, and temporary shoring (sheet pile temporary support of excavations).

Design wire faced MSE walls in accordance with SS867. Perform the design for external stability as an MSE wall according to BDM Section 0.
For a permanent application of this type of wall, galvanize the wire facing units in accordance with SS867.03.A, and provide a permanent cast-in-place or precast concrete facing.
307.10.2 263BFABRIC WRAPPED WALLS C307.10.2
Design fabric wrapped walls as reinforced soil slopes in accordance with publications FHWA-NHI-10-024 and FHWA-NHI-10-025, Geotechnical Engineering Circular 11 (GEC 11); and SS863 except that geosynthetics (geotextile sheets) comprise both the soil reinforcement and the face of the wall. Geotextiles used for fabric wrapped walls shall conform to Class 1 geotextile as specified in AASHTO M 288. Determine Ultimate Tensile Strength (strength per unit width) of the geotextile reinforcement from wide strip tests in accordance with ASTM D4595.
Fabric wrapped walls are also known as geotextile faced MSE walls. The face of a fabric wrapped wall is typically steeper than 1H:1V.

307.10.3.4 436BDESIGN CONSIDERATIONS C307.10.3.4
For sheet pile temporary support of excavations, specify in the project plans the minimum length of the sheet pile sections and minimum section modulus per unit width of the sheet pile. Only specify a minimum moment of inertia per unit width of the sheet pile if the design is deflection critical.
Provide a full detailed design in the project plans for all other aspects of a temporary support of excavation system, including walers, tiebacks, soldier piles, lagging, etc. Provide plan notes and detail drawings necessary to specify all aspects of the design; also provide Plan Note in BDM Section 611.3-1.
Following are some conceptual ideas for the design of Excavation Bracing:
A. A cantilever sheet pile wall should generally be used for excavation up to approximately 12-ft in height.
B. For cuts greater than 12-ft in height, anchored or braced walls will generally be required.
C. Braced walls using waler and struts can sometimes be braced against another rigid element on the excavated side.
D. The use of steel H-piles with lagging is also a practical solution for some sites. Please note that some railroad companies allow only interlocking steel sheet piling adjacent to their tracks.
E. Where sufficient embedment cannot be attained by driving sheet piling because of the location of shallow bedrock, predrilled holes into the bedrock with soldier H-piles and lagging should be considered.
308 15BSUPERSTRUCTURE
308.1 93BSPAN ARRANGEMENTS C308.1
The length of a bridge will be determined by the requirements for horizontal clearance at grade (highway or railway) separations, by the requirements for waterway opening at stream crossings or the presence of existing utilities and/or infrastructure. Typically for any given bridge, there are a number of combinations of spans and lengths of spans that can be utilized. Generally, a preferred span arrangement that minimizes the number of substructure units should be used (i.e. fewer piers with longer spans).
Where permitted by the ROW limits, the substructure units should be placed outside of the clear zone. Refer to L&amp;D, Vol. 1 for the definition of the clear zone.
For waterway crossings, an effort should be made to keep the substructure footings outside of the limits of the OHWM.
The number and/or type of substructure units should be based on a cost analysis. The Cost Analysis should examine the most economical number of spans required based on total bridge costs, including a substructure and superstructure cost optimization study. Site conditions will govern the location of substructure units with respect to required horizontal clearances, foundation conditions and appearance. Refer to BDM Section 200 for additional cost analysis considerations.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-141
308.2 94BSUPERSTRUCTURE TYPES C308.2
Select the type of superstructure used on the basis of safety, economy and appearance.
The types of superstructure generally used in Ohio consist of cast-in-place concrete slabs, prestressed concrete box or I-beams, and steel beams or welded plate girders. Since these superstructure types make up a large majority of the bridges in the inventory for the state of Ohio, these are the only structure types coved in this manual. For special conditions where other types of superstructures are being considered, consult the Office of Structural Engineering for recommendations and requirements prior to initiating the design.
For bridges with significant substructure costs, the difference in dead loads between the steel superstructure versus a concrete superstructure should be considered in the Structure Type Study, Cost Analysis for choosing the most economical structure type.
308.2.1 265BCONCRETE SLAB BRIDGES
<em>Design continuous reinforced concrete slab bridges in accordance with LRFD 4.6.2.3.</em>
For simple span reinforced concrete slab bridges cast in place directly on concrete substructures, consider the effective span length equal to the clear span plus 15-in.
Include a final deck surface elevation table in the plans. Show elevations for all profile grade lines, curblines, crown lines, and phased construction lines where they intersect bearing points, quarter-span points and mid-span points as well as any additional points required to meet a maximum spacing between points of 25-ft.
308.2.1.1 437BCS-1-24 C308.2.1.1
The details shown in bridge standard drawing CS-1-24 were designed to function with details shown in bridge standard drawings CPA-1-08 and CPP-1-08. These details were setup to allow the slab to behave as a beam rather than a frame.
When the details provided in CS-1-24 are being used in conjunction with a substructure unit(s) that differ from what is shown in bridge standard drawings CPA-1-08 and CPP-1-08, the design will need to provide suitable bearing condition to allow the beam type behavior.
<em>For a continuous concrete slab bridge, per CS-1-24, supported on rigid abutments, eliminate the A801 bar shown in CPA-1-08; trowel smooth the joint between the deck slab and the top of the abutment; and recess a continuous strip of elastomeric material into the abutment seat before placement of the superstructure concrete. Design the bearing system for the temperature movements described in BDM Section 1003.21 and bearing design requirements of LRFD 14.6.</em>
This modification creates a semi-integral type abutment for the slab bridge and maintains the beam type behavior with the slab.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025

If the slab is rigidly connected to rigid piers, custom design the slab/substructure. The details in CS-1-24 are not applicable.
308.2.2 266BSTRUCTURAL STEEL
308.2.2.1 438BPRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS &amp; GENERAL INFORMATION
C308.2.2.1
For spans greater than 60-ft, rolled beams, up to and including the 40-in depth, or welded plate girders should be considered.
Use continuous spans for multiple span steel beam and girder bridges.
The ratio of the length of the end spans to the intermediate spans usually should be 0.7 to 0.8. The latter ratio is preferred because it nearly equalizes the maximum positive moment of all spans. Integrally designed structures may have end span ratios of as low as 0.6 if prevention of uplift is considered. For multi-span, composite designed, rolled beams, the maximum intermediate span is generally around 120-ft. For single span, composite designed, rolled beams, the maximum span is generally around 100-ft.
While constant depth plate girders can be used in the same range as rolled beams, they are generally not as cost effective as rolled beams for the same span lengths. Consider haunching girders over the intermediate substructure units for spans greater than 350-ft. For additional information on optimizing steel structure types refer to the NSBA Steel Design Handbook.
Stringer type Span length
Rolled beam up to 100-ft (Simple) 120-ft (Continuous)
Constant Depth Girder 120-ft – 350-ft Haunched Girder &gt; 350-ft
The minimum economical beam spacing for rolled beams is approximately 8-ft. For plate girders a minimum spacing of 9-ft is generally recommended. Girder spacings between 11-ft and 14-ft typically yield the most efficient design for the section.
Steel rolled beam or girder highway bridges shall have a minimum of 4 stringer lines.
Utilize a composite section when designing structural steel.
Refer to LRFD 6.10.10.1 and BDM Section 1006 for more information.
Do not design deck slab overhangs to exceed 4-ft measured from the centerline of beam/girder to deck edge.
This limit is dependent on the maximum capacity of the overhang brackets contractors use to form the deck slab overhang.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-143
On over-the-side drainage structures, the minimum overhang shall be lesser of 75% of the beam/girder depth or 4-ft.
This requirement helps to reduce corrosion resulting from the surface drainage.
For designs that assume the unbraced length of the top flange to be zero, investigate the strength of the non-composite section during steel erection, deck slab construction, etc. using laterally unsupported lengths that reflect actual bracing conditions.
308.2.2.1.a 535BATTACHMENTS C308.2.2.1.a
Do not weld attachments, either permanent or temporary in tension areas. Limit welded attachments to compression areas.
Show the extent of the compression and tension areas in the detail plans.
<em>Base the extents of the compression and tension areas on the dead load of structural components and nonstructural attachments (DC).</em>
Show in the detail plans of steel beam and girder bridges where welded attachments are permitted for construction purposes.
Do not weld scuppers, down spouts or drainage supports in tension areas of primary members.
308.2.2.1.b 536BSTEEL FABRICATION QUALIFICATION
C308.2.2.1.b
Specify the required steel fabricator classification in the pay item for the structural steel.
The Department’s requirements for steel fabricators are defined in C&amp;MS 513 and S1078. Steel fabricators are classified according to their capabilities into eight levels (1 thru 6, SF &amp; UF). Levels 1 thru 6 require certification according to the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC). No AISC certification is required for Levels SF and UF.
The AISC categories of certification are listed here for information:
A.  AISC Category Sbr - Fabricators qualified for single span rolled beam bridges
B.  AISC Category Mbr - Fabricators qualified for all other bridge structures
C.  AISC has also established a P and F endorsement for fabricators:</li>
<li>P - Painting of steel structures endorsement</li>
<li>F - Fracture Critical endorsement

308.2.2.1.c 537BMAXIMUM AVAILABLE LENGTH OF STEEL MEMBER
C308.2.2.1.c
Consider reducing cost of structural steel members by providing field splices and allowing for optional field splices.
Length of a girder is generally limited by the ability to transport the member from the fabricator&#39;s shop to the job site. A length of 120-ft is generally the maximum trucking length between splices, but girder lengths of 160-ft and greater have been transported to project sites. When the trucking lengths exceed 110-ft contact local fabricators for NSBA for maximum shipping lengths.
Mills can supply lengths up to maximum shipping limits, but extra charges may be added for lengths over 80-ft.
The National Steel Bridge Alliance (NSBA) and the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) are available to provide assistance with material sizes.
308.2.2.1.d 538BSTRUCTURAL STEEL COATINGS C308.2.2.1.d
ASTM A709 50W/70W should be selected wherever applicable as it eliminates the need for a coating system on the entire beam and the maintenance associated with a coating system. See BDM Section 308.2.2.1.d.1 for additional information.
Specify an alternative coating system per BDM Section 308.2.2.1.d.2if a structure requires the steel to be ASTM A709 Grade 50.
For more information on steel materials, see BDM Section 304.1.
308.2.2.1.d.1 592BPRIMARY COATING SYSTEMS C308.2.2.1.d.1
The Department’s primary system is un-coated weathering steel. Weathering steel reduces the initial cost of the structure by approximately the cost of a three-coat paint system on the structure. It may also eliminate future maintenance coatings.
In suitable environments, uncoated weathering steel develops a thin oxidation layer, also called a surface patina, that is small grained (dense) and tightly adherent to the base metal. Once this oxidation layer builds to a sufficient thickness and density the exposure of the base metal to moisture and oxygen is blocked and further corrosion is greatly reduced
Do not use uncoated weathering steel for bridges over roadways that meet ALL of the following criteria:
A. Vertical clearance is 20-ft or less B. AADT is 50,000 or larger
C. ADTT is 20% or more
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-145
Do not use uncoated weathering steel when the low chord is 10-ft or less above the OHWM.
Proximity to industrial areas where concentrated chemical fumes may drift directly onto the bridge should be considered in the site-specific study.
Specify an alternative coating system when a site-specific study finds that un-coated weathering steel is not suitable.
Tunnel-like conditions should be considered in the site-specific study. These conditions can result in the protective patina not developing correctly due to increased moisture or deicing salt exposure and poor air circulation resulting in the steel deteriorating at a faster rate.
When weathering steel is specified for a site meeting the requirements for tunnel like conditions, apply a protective coating, per BDM 308.2.2.1.d.2, to the fascia beams/girders for the entire length of the structure. Refer to BDM Figure 308-1 for the section coating limits.
Tunnel-like conditions are defined as bridges over roadways that meet ALL of the following criteria:
A. Vertical clearance is 20-ft or less B. Bridges over interstates or four lane divided
highways
C. ADTT = 10% or more under the bridge D. Posted speed limit under the bridge is 55 mph or
greater

If the requirements of tunnel-like conditions are not met, aesthetics may still dictate that a protective coating system be applied to the entire length of fascia beams over traffic.
Apply a protective coating, per BDM 308.2.2.1.d.2, to all exposed weathering steel surfaces within 10-ft of the beam/girder end at abutments with expansion joints and 10-ft on both sides (20-ft total) at intermediate expansion joints. Also coat all cross-frames, end frames or other steel in these 10-ft sections.

Coat all surfaces at the ends of un-coated weathering steel bridges on integral or semi-integral abutments with an inorganic zinc prime coat to 1-ft past the end diaphragm. Show limits of zinc prime coat in the plans.
Apply a protective coating, per BDM 308.2.2.1.d.2, to weathering steel fascia beams/girders along their entire length for bridges with over-the-side drainage. Refer to BDM Figure 308-1 for the section coating limits.
Apply a protective coating, per BDM Section 308.2.2.1.d.2, to weathering steel fascia beams/girders along their entire length when the width of the gap between adjacent structures is less than 30-ft. Refer to BDM Figure 308-1 for the section coating limits.
De-icing salts are able to get between the structures and due to inadequate sun exposure and air circulation the fascia beams/girders stay wet for prolonged periods and are prone inadequate protective patina development and more rapid corrosion.
When a three-coat paint system is applied to the splice location, as shown in BDM Figure 308-1, use galvanized bolts at these splice locations.
In lieu of the three-coat system limits shown in BDM Figure 308-1 at the splice location, the owner may elect to apply a three-coat system at the same limits as the rest of the beam/girder. In this case, apply a shop applied zinc prime coat to all surfaces of the splice plates, filler plates, and faying surface of the beam/girder.
When applying a protective coating, per BDM 308.2.2.1.d.2, to only a portion of the beam, tint the top coat to a color closely matching AMS Standard 595A 20045 or 20059, the color of weathering steel.

308.2.2.1.d.2 593BALTERNATIVE COATING SYSTEMS
C308.2.2.1.d.2
Where the primary coating system is not applicable, coat the members of new steel structures with one of the following alternative coating systems:
A. Three-coat paint system B. Hot-dipped galvanized coating
C. Shop or field metallizing
The three-coat paint system shall consist of an inorganic zinc prime coat, an epoxy intermediate coat and a urethane finish coat (IZEU) in accordance with C&amp;MS 514.
This system has proven to have a life span of up to 30 years.
Typically, the inorganic prime coat is shop applied while the intermediate and top coats are field applied.
An IZEU three-coat shop applied system with field touch up may be the system of choice where:
A.  There is limited access to the superstructure in the field. Examples may include stream crossings with shallow clearances.
B.  The environment is especially sensitive to possible construction debris.
C.  The bridge is located in a highly urbanized area that may have limited access for future coatings.
The shop applied IZEU three-coat system may provide a better protective coating than the standard field applied system due to the fabricator’s automated blasting processes, environmental controls and better coating application access. However, the total cost of the shop-applied system is higher than the standard field applied system. Extra costs include special care needed during shipping and erection, field painting of field splices, field touch up, final cleaning and possible time delays to the project due to the additional shop work. Additionally, all field connections are to be bolted to minimize the damage to the coating by field welding.
If a shop applied three-coat system is selected, refer to C&amp;MS 514.16 for additional information.
A galvanized coating system is an alternative for new steel structures. Galvanized systems are proven durable up to 40 years.
When a galvanized coating system is specified, contact the American Galvanizers Association to confirm the structural members detailed can be galvanized in a regional plant.
Galvanizing tanks are relatively shallow and normally not longer than 45-ft in length. Therefore, beam lengths should not be longer than 60-ft. Additional information on regional galvanizer size restrictions is available from the American Galvanizers Association.
Refer for BDM Section 308.2.2.1.j for bolt hole sizes for bolted connections of galvanized members.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-148
Do not field weld end cross-frames and intermediate cross-frames on galvanized or metallized structures.
Bolted cross-frames will be required. Bolted cross-frames as detailed in the Standard Bridge Drawing GSD-1-19 may be specified.
When welding on galvanized member is required, repair the galvanizing per C&amp;MS 711.02.
Welding onto galvanizing causes damage to the coating and should be avoided wherever possible.
Required plan or proposal notes for the galvanized coating system are available upon request with the Office of Structural Engineering.
Shop or field metallizing shall be in accordance with SS845.
A shop applied metallizing system is another alternative coating system, but the costs are relatively high compared to the standard IZEU system.
Metallized systems have an expected life similar to galvanizing. Metallized coating systems should have field bolted connections rather than field welded connections, but oversized holes are not required. Metallizing, as compared to galvanizing, has no limit on the size of members being coated and causes no additional distortion from heat.
When un-coated weathering steel is not suitable for a bridge of a railroad, galvanized or metalized coating systems should be considered. Any structural alternative with any type of paint system, including coated weathering steel, should be avoided in these locations because it may not be possible to get access the structure for future maintenance.
308.2.2.1.e 539BOUTSIDE MEMBER CONSIDERATIONS
C308.2.2.1.e
Evaluate the actual loads for outside primary members. Heavy sidewalks, large overhangs of the concrete deck slab and/or live loads may cause higher loads on an outside member than loads on an internal member.
<em>This analysis requirement does not alleviate the designer from conforming to LRFD 4.6.2.2.1 (i.e. “…exterior girders of multibeam bridges shall not have less resistance than an interior beam.).</em>
308.2.2.1.f 540BCAMBER &amp; DEFLECTIONS C308.2.2.1.f
Do not include the loading for future wearing surfaces in determining required shop camber.
When establishing dead load deflection for determining the required shop camber of composite beam or girder bridges with concrete deck slabs and determining deck screed elevations, the weight of curbs, metal railings, concrete railings and separate wearing surface may be equally distributed to all beams.
In the deflection and camber table in the design plans, detail all points for each beam or girder line for the full length of the bridge. Detail bearing points, quarter-span points, mid-span points and splice points and any additional points required to meet a maximum spacing between points of 25-ft.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-149
In cases of special geometry (e.g. spirals, horizontal or vertical curves, superelevation transitions, etc.), provide additional points in the deflection and camber table if the normally required points do not adequately define the required curvature of a beam or girder.
In all cases, calculate the required shop camber as the algebraic sum of the computed deflections, vertical curve adjustment and horizontal curve adjustment. Measure camber to a chord between adjacent bearing points.
Provide a camber diagram showing the location of the points defined above and giving vertical offset dimensions at the bearing points from a “Base” or “Work” line between abutment bearings.
308.2.2.1.g 541BFATIGUE DETAIL CATEGORY
In order to allow for future rehabilitation involving welded attachments less than 2.0-in., the fatigue limit state loading for steel members in the tensile stress and /or stress reversal regions shall not exceed the nominal fatigue resistance for Detail Category C.
308.2.2.1.h 542BTOUGHNESS TESTS C308.2.2.1.h
On steel structures, main load carrying members (primary members such as beams, moment plates, bolted joint splice plates excluding fill plates, etc.) require Charpy V Notch Testing. Identify these components on the detail plans by placing “(CVN)” after the component&#39;s description.
Example: W36x150 (CVN)
Designate the web and all flanges of plate girders as a CVN material.
Cross-frame members, cross-frame connection stiffeners and gusset plates on horizontally curved beam or girder structures are primary members. Identify these items as CVN on the detail plans.
Bracing members are considered primary members in curved bridges since they transmit forces necessary to provide equilibrium.
308.2.2.1.i 543BSTANDARD END CROSS-FRAMES C308.2.2.1.i
Support expansion devices with end cross-frames. If end cross-frame details shown in the standards for the expansion device are not used, design the end cross-frame to limit the maximum deflection in the expansion devise to L/2000.
End cross-frames are needed for support and reduction of deflection of expansion device. Standard expansion joints have designs already established as part of the standard drawings.

308.2.2.1.j 544B OLTED SPLICES C308.2.2.1.j
For bolted connections of galvanized structures using bolts 7/8” diameter or less, detail the diameter of the bolt holes to be 1/8-in larger than the bolt diameter. For bolted connections of galvanized structures using bolts 1” diameter or greater, detail the diameter of the bolt holes to be 3/16-in larger than the bolt diameter.
Since standard holes may become partially filled with galvanizing, bolted splice designs will require a non-standard hole size. This will also decrease the splice capacity.
Design allowable bolt stresses for painted surfaces based on AASHTO &#39;s values for Class A, Contact Surface, Standard Hole Type.
Design allowable bolt stresses for unpainted weathering steel surfaces based on AASHTO &#39;s values for Class B, Contact Surface, Standard Hole Type.
Design allowable bolt stresses for metallized surfaces based on AASHTO’s values for Class B, Contact Surface, Standard Hole Type.
Design allowable bolt stresses for galvanized surfaces based on AASHTO’s values for Class C, Contact Surface, Oversized Hole Type.
For splices at bend points, place the lines of holes in the beam or girder flanges parallel to the centerline of the web. If the bend angle is small enough use rectangular splice plates (splice plates shall not overhang flange by more than 1/2-in and inside splice plates shall not have to be trimmed to clear web or web to flange radius).  When the angle is too large to allow rectangular splice plates, trim the plates to align with the flange edges. Meet the minimum edge distances defined in BDM Section 308.2.2.1.j.2for both cases.
<em>For bearing type compression splices, such as in a column, mill the ends of the spliced members to be in full bearing. For compression splice members with milled ends, meet the requirements of LRFD 6.13.6.1.2. Specify the fit requirements of the mating surfaces in the plans.</em>
The designer should recognize that “FULL BEARING” of beams and girders is not defined by AASHTO. “FULL BEARING” is defined for this application as 75 percent of the bearing surface in contact and the other 25 percent with no gap greater than 1/32-in.
Alternatively, a slip-critical type connection can be used to avoid milling the beam ends.
Refer to BDM Figure 308-2 for additional bolted splice details.

Specify the diameter of the bolts and provide the ASTM F3125, Grade A325 bolt type in the coating notes or bolt material specifications.
Use Type I bolts for structures with coating systems that are zinc based, such as OZEU, IZEU, galvanizing or metallizing.
Use Grade A325, Type III bolts for un-coated weathering steel. If the faying surfaces under both the head and nut of every bolt of a weathering steel member are coated, specify galvanized Grade A325 Type I bolts. Otherwise, specify Grade A325, Type III bolts.
308.2.2.1.j.2 595BEDGE DISTANCE C308.2.2.1.j.2
<em>For design and detailing purposes, increase the minimum edge distances listed in LRFD Table 6.13.2.6.6-1 by 1/4-in.</em>
The edge distances provided in LRFD 6.13.2.6.6 are absolute minimums allowed during fabrication. This increase will allow for fabrication tolerances when drilling bolt holes in splice plates, especially the inside flange splice plates.
308.2.2.1.j.3 596BLOCATION OF FIELD SPLICES C308.2.2.1.j.3
Bolted splices should be located at points of dead load contraflexure on a continuous span structure. Splices may also be supplied to help meet shipping and handling limitations. Plans should show optional field splice locations.

<em>Design shear connectors in accordance with LRFD 6.10.10.</em>
Use automatic end-welded type shear connectors. Do not use channel sections for shear connectors.
The Department recommends 7/8-in diameter studs as a standard diameter. Check for availability with manufacturers regarding the length of stud specified in the plans.
<em>Detail the shear studs so that the requirements of LRFD 6.10.10.1.4 are met.</em>
The Department’s policy of using a 2-in deep haunch over the top flange will have an effect on the length of shear studs. For deeper haunches refer to BDM Section 403.5.2 for haunch reinforcement requirements.
Field install shear studs. In the case of galvanized structures, install the shear studs per C&amp;MS 513.22.

C308.2.2.2.a
Do not use intermediate stiffeners for rolled beams. Size connection plates to be a minimum thickness of 3/8-in and wide enough to make an adequate cross-frame connection.
Intermediate transverse stiffeners are defined as plates used to stiffening the web of the beam and are not connected to the cross-frames. Connection plates are defined as plates used to connect cross-frames to beams.
When determining the width of the connection plates, consider the ease of access for the cross-frame connections. Connection plates should not extend beyond the edge of flange.
Clip corners of connection plates in contact with both web and flange. Clip the stiffener 1-in horizontally and 2.5-in vertically.
Connection plate clip details are shown on the Standard Bridge Drawing GSD-1-19.

C308.2.2.2.b
For structures with the stringers placed on tangent alignments, detail cross-frames as follows:
A1.  Do not exceed 25-ft for cross-frame spacings between points of dead load contraflexure in the positive moment regions.
B1.  Do not exceed 15-ft for cross-frame spacings between points of dead load contraflexure in the negative moment regions.
C1.  Connect cross-frames for rolled beams directly to either connection plates or gusset plates that are bolted to connection plates.
See the General Steel Details Standard Bridge Drawing, GSD-1-19, for standard cross-frame configurations.
<em>For additional information on cross-frame layout refer to LRFD 6.7.4.2 and Skewed and Curved Steel I-Girder Bridge Fit by NSBA.</em>
D1. When the nominal depth of the beam is less than 36-in, use structural steel channel diaphragms rather than cross-frames.
When the nominal depth of the rolled beam is 36-in, either channel diaphragms or cross-frames may be used.
E1.  Place cross-frames perpendicular to stringers. This does not apply to skewed pier diaphragms.
For structures with flared stringers, the following exceptions apply:
A2.  If the differential angle between individual stringers is 5-degrees or less, place the cross-frames perpendicular to one stringer and in line across the total width of the structure.
B2.  If the differential angle between individual stringers is greater than 5-degrees, divide the differential angle evenly between connections to both stringers.
Show the following in the design plans:
A3. The cross-frame spacing for each region along the length of the stringer.
B3. The typical cross-frame details or reference to the General Steel Details Standard Bridge Drawing, GSD-1-19, for standard cross-frame configurations.
Ensure cross-frame locations do not conflict with bolted splices or provide appropriate details to attach cross-frames at bolted splice locations.
In accordance with C&amp;MS 513.26, the fabricator shall detail all cross-frames to fit with the webs plumb at the completion of superstructure erection. This condition applies to all cross-frame/diaphragm bays without closure pours.
This condition is referred to as Steel Dead Load Fit (SDLF) in the National Steel Bridge Alliance (NSBA) document, Skewed and Curved Steel I-Girder Bridge Fit.
For steel superstructures constructed under phased construction, do not permanently attach cross-frames/diaphragms between phases until the deck placement on each side of the closure pour is complete.
Refer to BDM Section 309.3.8.5 closure pour requirements.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-154
In bays with closure pours, provide a plan note requiring the fabricator to detail cross-frames to fit at the completion of deck placement on each side of the closure pour.
Standard Bridge Drawing, GSD-1-19, provides oversized holes in the cross-frame/diaphragm members and standard sized holes in the connection plates. This combination provides the following center hole alignment tolerance for bolt fit between the cross-frame/diaphragm member and connection plates:
A1. Intermediate X-frame: ± 1/8-in
B1. Diaphragm: ± 3/16-in  If the cross-frames are sized to fit prior to deck
placement, and the deflections due to deck placement on each side of the closure pour differ by more than these alignment tolerances, then the connection bolts will not fit. The use of standard sized holes commonly specified in non-standard cross-frame configurations reduces these fit tolerances even more.
This differing fit condition for closure bay cross-frames will require the plans to include the following deflection values in the camber and deflection table:
A2. Deflection due to weight of steel
B2. Deflection due to staged deck placement including weight of portable concrete barrier
C2. Deflection due to remaining dead load  Fabricating the bracing members to fit after the deck
placements on each side of the closure pour will help with bolt alignment in the field, but the deflection values specified may not be sufficiently accurate to avoid conflicts. One of the following conditions is also recommended:
A3. For bracing systems utilizing gusset plates, specify all cross-frame‒to‒gusset plate connections to be field welded on one of the beam/girder lines and shop welded on the other.
B3. For bracing systems without gusset plates, specify all bolt holes in the connection plate on one of the beam/girder lines to be field drilled and shop drilled on the other.
For bridges with “dog-legged” stringers, install cross-frames no greater than 12-in from the bend points. Place cross-frame normal to the stringer used to set the 1-ft clearance dimension and connect to the adjacent stringer only on the same side of the centerline of the splice. Place an additional horizontal angle near the top flange of the stringers.
The cross-frame units should be similar to standard cross-frames.
See BDM Figure 308-3 for plan view layout of cross-frames for dog-legged stringers.

When standard cross-frames with a top strut are used for curved stringers, confirm that the cross-frames and their connections meet the additional loading developed in a curved member design. If specially designed cross-frames are used, bolt the cross-frames to stiffeners with oversized holes. Include the reduction in allowable capacity associated with standard bolt holes in the design. Refer to BDM Section 308.2.2.1.h for material toughness requirements.
Cross-frames for curved stringers may be one of the types shown on the Standard Bridge Drawing, GSD -1-19, with an additional top strut. However, the use of oversized holes as specified in GSD-1-19 are not permitted for curved structures.

C&amp;MS 513 permits welding by the following processes:
A.  Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW) B.  Flux Cored Arc Welding (FCAW)
C.  Submerged Arc Welding (SAW) Fabricators may choose to use one or more of these processes and each process has its advantages. Therefore, the designer should not specify the process.

Do not terminate fully welded moment plates where the calculated total stresses are tensile.
End bolted cover plates, as defined in AASHTO, are acceptable for use in zones of tensile stress if cost effective. Welded moment plates may be economical in the compression flange areas over the piers of continuous span structures and may be investigated by the designer.
308.2.2.3 440BGIRDERS
308.2.2.3.a 551BGENERAL C308.2.2.3.a
Investigate multiple designs to determine the most economical option.
Often a design with an unstiffened web, eliminating transverse stiffeners, is the most economical. In this context, the term “unstiffened web” refers to a web without stiffeners except for the stiffeners used to connect cross-frames. A design with a thicker unstiffened web is also desirable from a maintenance standpoint because field and shop painting of stiffeners is a problem and is often a localized point of failure for the coating system. The NSBA and AISI are available to evaluate your options.
Do not use longitudinal stiffeners.
<em>For haunched girders, detail the corner between the flat bottom flange bearing seat area and the curved section of the bottom flange as two plates with a full penetration weld. Give the fabricator the option of hot bending this flange per AASHTO LRFD Bridge Construction Specifications Section 11.4.3.3.3. A detail note is provided in BDM Section 702.15.</em>

This section is not intended to recommend fracture critical designs. The designer should make all efforts to not develop a structure design that requires fracture critical members.
Structures with fracture critical details require a concurrent detail design review to be performed by the Office of Structural Engineering.
<em>Fracture critical members are defined in Section 2, Definitions, of the AASHTO/AWS D1.5, Chapter 12 Fracture Control Plan.</em>
<em>If a bridge design includes members or their components that are fracture critical, clearly identify those members and components as FRACTURE CRITICAL MEMBERS (FCM) in the plans. Designate fracture critical welds as FCM in the plans. Include the detail note provided in BDM Section 702.16 that references the appropriate sections of the AASHTO/AWS Bridge Welding Code.</em>
If a girder is non-redundant, include the entire girder in the pay quantity for ITEM 513 - STRUCTURAL STEEL MEMBERS, LEVEL 6.  Designate the tension and compression zones in the fracture critical members.
308.2.2.3.c 553BWIDTH &amp; THICKNESS REQUIREMENTS
308.2.2.3.c.1 599BFLANGES C308.2.2.3.c.1
In the design of welded steel girders, the thickness of the flange plates is varied along the length of the girder in accordance with the bending moment. Each change in plate thickness requires a complete penetration butt-weld in the flange plate. These butt-welds are an expensive shop operation requiring considerable labor. In determining the points where changes in plate thickness occur, the designer should weigh the cost of butt-welded splices against extra plate thickness. In many cases it may be advantageous to continue the thicker plate beyond the theoretical stepdown point to avoid the cost of the butt-welded splice.
In order to help make this decision, guidelines proposed by United States Steel in their pamphlet “Fabrication - Its Relation to Design, Shop Practices, Delivery and Costs” may be used. The amount of steel that must be saved to justify providing a welded splice should be as follows:
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-158
A.  For A709 grade 36 steel:  300-lb + (25-lb X cross sectional area, in in2, of the
lighter flange plate)
B.  For A709 grade 50 &amp; 50W steel, the cutoff point shall be 85 percent of the value for grade 36 material.
In addition to design limitations of width to thickness, design flanges to be wide enough such that the girder will have the necessary lateral strength for handling and erection. Employ the following two empirical rules:
A1. bf  = dw/6 + 2.5 ≥ 12-in B1.  bfc ≥ L/85
Where: bf = full width of either girder flange rounded
up to the nearest inch (in) bfc = full width of the compression flange (in)
L = length of the girder shipping piece (in) dw = web depth (in)
Design the flange to have a minimum thickness of 7/8-in. Use the following for selection of flange thicknesses:
A2.  For material 7/8-in to 3-in thick, specify thickness in 1/8-in increments.
B2.  For material greater than 3-in thick, specify thickness in 1/4-in increments.
Whenever possible, use constant flange widths throughout the length of the girder.
308.2.2.3.c.2 600BWEBS
Use a minimum web thickness of 3/8-in.
See BDM Section 308.2.2.3.a for recommendations on use of unstiffened web designs
308.2.2.3.d 554BINTERMEDIATE STIFFENERS &amp; CONNECTION PLATES
C308.2.2.3.d
Intermediate transverse stiffeners are defined as plates used to stiffening the web of the girder and are not connected to the cross-frames. Connection plates are defined as plates used to connect cross-frames to beams.
Design intermediate web stiffeners with a minimum thickness of 3/8-in. Clip the corners of the stiffeners that extend beyond the edge of flange at a 45-degree angle. Make all intermediate stiffeners the same size.
Use single stiffeners on alternate sides of the web of interior girders and only the inside of the web for fascia girders. Weld these stiffeners to the web and the compression flange. Make the top tension flange a tight fit.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025

Weld connection plates to the web and both flanges to help eliminate cracking of the web due to out of plane bending. Investigate that the fatigue criteria is met in these areas.
Do not stitch weld or single side weld stiffeners and/or connection plates.
Clip corners of stiffeners and connection plates in contact with both web and flange. Clip the stiffener 1-in horizontally and 2.5-in vertically.
For details of stiffeners refer to the Standard Bridge Drawing GSD-1-19.
308.2.2.3.e 555BINTERMEDIATE CROSS-FRAMES C308.2.2.3.e
Connect cross-frames for girders to intermediate web stiffeners as shown in the Standard Bridge Drawing, GSD-1-19.
For plate girder bridges, provide erection bolts for the connections of cross-frames to girder stiffeners.
For additional intermediate cross-frame information, refer to BDM Section 308.2.2.2.b.
Erection bolts are normally 5/8-in diameter. Bolt holes should generally be oversized. See the General Steel Details standard bridge drawing for typical details.

There are generally two (2) types of welds acceptable for bridge fabrication, fillet and complete penetration welds.
308.2.2.3.f.2 602BMINIMUM SIZE OF FILLET &amp; COMPLETE PENETRATION WELDS, PLAN REQUIREMENTS
C308.2.2.3.f.2
Refer to BDM Section 308.2.2.2.c.1 for additional information on minimum fillet weld sizes.
Do not use partial penetration welds, except for secondary members not subject to tension or reversal stresses.
Complete or full Penetration welds are by definition welded through the full section of the plates to be joined.
Specify either fillet weld leg size, in the case of fillet welds, or CP (complete penetration) for complete joint penetration groove welds. Do not detail actual complete penetration welded joints symbols but only show the requirement that the welded joint be Complete Joint Penetration, CP.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-160
Inspection and acceptance of a complete penetration weld is based on whether the weld will be loaded in tension or compression. In order to utilize this permissible quality difference between welds subjected to only compression or tension stresses, designate in the detail plans for steel girders all flange butt welds that are subjected to compressive stresses only. Make this designation by placing the letters “CS” next to full penetration welds shown on detail drawings. Place the following explanatory legend on the same detail sheet:
CS - indicates butt weld subject to compressive stresses only.

C308.2.2.3.f.3
Refer to BDM Section 308.2.2.2.c.2 for additional information on NDT requirements.
For bridges carrying railroads, when full penetration web to flange welds are specified, add a note requiring 10 percent ultrasonic inspection. Check the AREMA specifications and with the actual railroad to confirm the individual railroad&#39;s requirements for NDT of welds.
308.2.2.3.g 557BCURVED GIRDER DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
C308.2.2.3.g
When designing curved girder structures, investigate all temporary and permanent loading conditions including loading from wet concrete in the deck pour for all stages of construction. Consider future re-decking as a separate loading condition. Design diaphragms as full load carrying members and according to BDM Section308.2.2.2.b. Perform a three-dimensional analysis representing the structure as a whole and as it will exist during all intermediate stages and under all construction loadings.
A three-dimensional analysis is essential to accurately predict stresses and deflections in all girders and diaphragms and to ensure that the structure is stable during all construction stages and loading conditions.
Include basic erection data on the contract plans. As a minimum, include the following information:
A. If temporary supports are required, provide the location of the assumed temporary support points, reactions and deflections for each construction stage and loading condition.
Further design information for curved structures is contained in the “Guide Specifications for Horizontally Curved Highway Bridges”, published by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.
B. Instructions to the Contractor as to when and how to fasten connections for cross-frames or diaphragms to assure stability during all temporary conditions.
Use standard bolt holes for intermediate and end cross-frame connections and lateral bracing
Over-sized bolt holes and slotted holes can lead to excessive unforeseen movements during the erection process.

C308.2.3
The Bridge Design Manual and Standard Bridge Drawings PSBD-2-07 and PSID-1-13 represent standard practice for the prestressed industry in Ohio.
When considering design deviations from these publications, contact the Ohio Prestressers Association and/or the PCI Central Region to request documentation that the deviation is acceptable and can be produced within the project timeframe by at least two independent producers prequalified under S1079.
ODOT may request verification of this documentation during project reviews. These industry organizations are also valuable resources for preliminary pricing and practical hauling limitations to specific project locations.
Model multi-span, non-composite members as simple-span for all loading conditions. Define the live load and future wearing surface as stated in BDM Section 303.1.
Model multi-span, composite members using the two loading conditions that follow:
A. Design the beams as simple-span for all loading conditions. Define the live load and future wearing surface as stated in BDM Section 303.1.
B. Design the deck reinforcing for beams per BDM Section 309.3.4
308.2.3.1 441BTRANSPORTATION &amp; HANDLING CONSIDERATIONS
C308.2.3.1
Consider the site limitations for beam hauling. While weight of a precast bridge member is not typically a limiting factor, its length and ability to reach the jobsite may be a restriction. Maximum lengths are normally dictated by the smallest turning radius enroute to the project site.
For beams 100-ft long or more, contact at least two approved fabricators of precast bridge members to obtain a written agreement stating that the member can be shipped to the project site. Include the agreements in the Structure Type Study, Narrative of Bridge Alternatives.
In order to prevent damaging the beams during transit and erection, fabricators may require additional strands to be placed in the top flange. These shipping strands keep the top flange in compression until the beams are set into final position. Once set, the shipping strands are cut to release their prestressing force and allow the beams to reach their design ultimate capacity.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-162
308.2.3.2 442BLENGTH ADJUSTMENTS
In order to prevent fabrication mistakes for beam length, address the effect that the longitudinal grade has on dimensions measured along a beam’s length in the plans. When the beam length measured along the grade differs from the beam length measured horizontally by more than 3/8-in, clearly label all affected dimensions measured along the length of the beam so that the fabricator can make the necessary allowances in the Shop Drawings. A Typical Detail note is available in BDM Section 702.6.
308.2.3.3 443B OX BEAMS C308.2.3.3
Refer to BDM Section 304 for concrete and reinforcing material requirements for box beams and concrete wearing surfaces.
Do not use box beams with a span to depth ratio exceeding L/36. Do not include the deck in the depth for the ratio.
Do not specify box beams that exceed 42-in in depth.
Refer to BDM Section 308.2.3 when considering a deviation from standard prestressed practice in Ohio.
The span limits for prestressed, side by side, concrete box beams generally range from 15-ft to 100-ft. These span limits are based on designs with 0.167-in2 low relaxation strands, a concrete 28-day compressive strength of 7.0-ksi, and a release strength of 5.0-ksi.
Do not use non-composite prestressed box beam superstructures on four lane divided highways or where the total ADTT is greater than 250. Do not use composite box beam superstructures with a single mat of deck reinforcement on four lane divided highways or where the total ADTT exceeds 1000. For locations not meeting acceptable requirements for box beams using the previous criteria, a composite deck slab reinforced with two mats of reinforcement and a thickness in accordance with BDM Section 309.3.1 is required.
Shear keys have proven to perform poorly under high ADTT loading.
Box beams are acceptable on curved alignment where the mid-ordinate is 6-in or less and the required bridge width is provided.
Do not use 36-in and 48-in wide box beams in the same span.
Mixing the beam sizes can lead to construction and long-term serviceability issues due to differential camber and deflections. If mixing the beams is unavoidable due to site conditions and has been specified in the Scope of Services, an effort should be made by the designer and fabricator to make the beam cambers as close as possible. The fabricator will need to cast the beams at similar times to avoid differential camber due to the age of the beams.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-163
The maximum asphalt wearing surface thickness for a non-composite designed box beam bridge is 8-in.
For multiple span bridges, use the same beam depth for all spans.
Individual span lengths may vary.
Do not change the physical dimensions and/or section properties of box beam cross sections from what is shown in standard bridge drawing PSBD-2-07.
Box beam ends are limited to a maximum skew of 30-degrees.
Refer to BDM Section 404.4.2 for additional information and possible alternatives.
Join multiple span box beam bridges over the piers with a T-joint as shown in standard bridge drawing PSBD-2-07.
Accommodate expansion at the piers by elastomeric expansion bearings or by flexibility of the piers for integral designs.
Design the length of abutment and pier seats of prestressed concrete box beam bridges long enough to accommodate the total width out-to-out of all beams including a fit-up allowance of 1/2-in per joint between beams
Support each prestressed box beam member with two bearings at each support.
For box beam bridges that have skew combined with grade or which have variable superelevation, design and dimension beam seats to provide support for the full width of the box beams.
If a bridge structure&#39;s geometry causes a bridge deck in an individual span to have a different cross slope at one bearing than at the other bearing, evenly divide the difference so that the box beam seat cross slopes at the bearings for both beam ends are the same. Accommodate elevation differences created by this beam seat adjustment in the overlay, whether asphaltic or concrete.
This adjustment gives the box beam full support at the seat without creating any twist or torsion on the box beam.
Do not cast abutment wingwalls above the bridge seat and backwalls until after box beams have been erected. Separate the cast in place wingwall and box beams by 1-in joint filler per C&amp;MS 705.03. Show both requirements in the plans.
Casting the backwall and wingwalls after the box beams are erected eliminates installation problems associated with the actual physical dimensions of the box beam and the joint filler. Cracking and spalling of backwall and wingwall concrete due to movements of the elastomeric bearings is also alleviated.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-164
For box beam bridges with steel railing, detail the post spacing and position of post anchorage on the plans. Reference the dimensioning for the post to each prestressed beam end. Ensure the post anchor spacing does not interfere with tierod locations or the &#34;T&#34; joint over the pier. Confirm that post anchors at the ends of skewed box beams have both adequate concrete cover and do not interfere with the tierods.
If the designer finds that no post spacing option can comply with these requirements, the option of relocating the tie rods may be chosen. See bridge standard drawing PSBD-2-07 for maximum allowable spacing of tie rods.
Encase all box beam ends in concrete. See BDM Figure 306-7 and BDM Figure 306-8 for additional information.
308.2.3.3.a 558BDEBONDED STRANDS
Straight pretensioned strands debonded at the ends of beams are acceptable subject to the following restrictions:
A. Do not debond more than 45% of the strands in a given row.
B. Do not debond more than six strands to the same length. When a total of ten or fewer strands are debonded, do not debond more than four strands to the same length.
C. Longitudinally space debonding termination locations at least 60 times the strand diameter apart.
D. Distribute debonded strands symmetrically about the vertical centerline of the cross-section of the member. Terminate debonding symmetrically at the same longitudinal location.
E. Alternate bonded and debonded strand locations both horizontally and vertically.
<em>F. Where a portion or portions of a prestressing strand are debonded and where tension exists in the precompressed tensile zone, determine the development lengths, measured from the end of the debonded zone, using LRFD Eq. 5.9.4.3.2-1 with a value of κ = 2.0.</em>
G. For simple span precast, prestressed beams, the maximum debonding length from the beam end is the smaller of 20 percent of the span length or one half the span length minus the development length.
H. Uniformly distribute debonded strands between webs.
I. Bond the outer-most strands within the section.
308.2.3.3.b 559BSTRAND SPACING
Space strands at increments or multiples of 2-in.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025

Place the centerline of the first row of strands 2-in from the bottom of the beam. Completely enclose all strands with the #4 stirrup bars. Place strands near the top flange below all transverse and longitudinal concrete reinforcement and to the left and right of the void.
308.2.3.3.c 560BCOMPOSITE DESIGN C308.2.3.3.c
The minimum thickness of composite reinforced deck slabs on prestressed box beams is 6-in and reinforced with #6 bars. Space the longitudinal bars at 18-in maximum and the transverse bars spaced at 9-in maximum.
For ease of placement on skewed structures, the transverse bars may be placed parallel to the substructure units with spacing measured parallel to the longitudinal axis of the structure.
<em>On multiple span composite box beam bridges, provide additional longitudinal reinforcing over the piers. Use #6 bars for the additional reinforcement. Space the additional bars alternately between the standard longitudinal reinforcement. The length of the additional reinforcement over the pier is the larger of: 40 percent of the length of the longer adjacent stringer span or a length that meets the requirements of LRFD 5.10.8.1.2c. Place the pier bars longitudinally and approximately centered on the pier but with a 3-ft stagger.</em>
Incorporate fit-up tolerances into the finished deck width for composite box beam structures with concrete railings or sidewalks. See BDM Figure 308-4 for a sketch of the cross-section of the composite deck superstructure.
Figure 308-4
If the required roadway width is wider than the box beam superstructure width, the composite deck may be designed to overhang the box beams a maximum of 8-in each side.

308.2.3.3.d 561BNON-COMPOSITE DESIGN C308.2.3.3.d
Specify Type 3 Waterproofing to be used for non-composite box beam bridges with asphalt overlays per C&amp;MS 512. Place the waterproofing on the boxes before the first layer of asphaltic concrete is applied. See BDM Sections 309.1.B and 309.2.
Provide over-the-side drainage when non-composite design is used.
Only use non-composite box beams with integral or semi-integral abutments.
Do not use non-composite box beams for structure with a total length exceeding 475-ft.
Limit non-composite box beam bridges with asphalt overlays to a 4 percent combined grade. Combined grade (Cg) includes both the longitudinal and transverse structure grades calculated as follows:
Cg = ([deck slope]2 + [transverse grade]2)1/2
For a normal transverse deck grade horizontal to vertical of 3/16-in per foot (1.56 percent), the maximum roadway grade would be 3.68 percent or less for non-composite design.
Use a composite deck as described in BDM Section 308.2.3.3.c when the combined deck grade is greater than 4 percent.
308.2.3.3.e 562BCAMBER C308.2.3.3.e
The topping thickness on prestressed box beam superstructures will vary along the length of the beams to account for beam camber and other vertical elevation adjustments. Proper determination of the topping thickness is crucial in order to properly establish beam seat elevations.
As shown in BDM Figure 308-5, determine the topping thickness (Tx) at any point, x, along the length of a prestressed box beam superstructure by the following:
Tx = A + Bx + C + Dt,x - E
Where: A = Design deck thickness
Bx = Vertical grade adjustment  C = Sacrificial haunch depth
Dt,x = Beam camber adjustment at member age  equal to Day t
E = Haunch adjustment
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-167
Figure 308-5
308.2.3.3.e.1 604BVERTICAL GRADE ADJUSTMENT (Bx)
C308.2.3.3.e.1
Minimize the vertical grade adjustment along the length of the bridge by setting the linear grade between the beam ends parallel to the tangent of the vertical grade at the midpoint of the beam span (see BDM Figure 308-5).
The Vertical Grade Adjustment accounts for any elevation differences between a non-linear profile grade and the linear grade connecting the centerline of beam supports. The value of the Vertical Grade Adjustment depends on many geometric factors such as vertical curvature, skew, cross-slope transitions, etc.
308.2.3.3.e.2 605BSACRIFICIAL HAUNCH DEPTH (C)
C308.2.3.3.e.2
The purpose of the Sacrificial Haunch Depth is to account for camber in excess of that calculated in the Beam Camber Adjustment above and account for the roadway cross-slope.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-168
For multiple span box beam bridges with design speeds exceeding 45-mph, the minimum thickness of the Sacrificial Haunch Depth (C) is 2-in. For all other box beam bridges, the minimum thickness of Sacrificial Haunch Depth (C) is 0-in.
Because box beams are set on sloping seats that approximate the cross-slope, the sacrificial haunch depth is typically constant.
If the wearing surface cross slope is different than then beam seat at the beam bearings as noted in BDM Section 308.2.3.3, the difference between the cross slope and the beam seat slope will be accommodated by the sacrificial haunch depth.
The minimum thickness, C, will occur at the outside edge of the fascia beam on the low side of the cross slope.
308.2.3.3.e.3 606B EAM CAMBER ADJUSTMENT (Dt,x)
C308.2.3.3.e.3
As prestressed concrete beams age, beam camber will increase due to concrete creep under the constant loading from the prestressing force. Although designers cannot accurately predict the girder age when the deck is placed, general assumptions can be made to prevent camber growth from becoming an issue during construction.
Show two values for camber at midspan in the design plans which the contractor can use to establish seat elevations according to C&amp;MS 511.07 and tolerance according to C&amp;MS 515.17: camber at Day 0 (D0) and camber at Day 30 (D30). These values represent the midspan camber in the beams before application of any dead load other than self-weight.
<em>To determine these camber values, calculate the creep coefficient, ψ(t,ti), according to LRFD 5.4.2.3.2 with humidity (H) equal to 70%; age of concrete at release (ti) equal to 0.75 days; and V/S and f′ci according to the project requirements. To calculate the creep coefficient at Day 0 and Day 30, use a maturity of concrete (t) equal to 0 days and 30 days respectively</em>
The respective camber values are found by multiplying the net midspan camber at the time of release by the appropriate creep coefficient as follows:
D30 = [1+ ψ(t,ti)] D0
The net camber at the time of release (δnet,x) is the difference between the initial beam camber due to the prestressing force (δo,x) and beam deflection due to self-weight (δsw,x) [i.e. δnet,x = δo,x - δsw,x].
For the purposes of determining the topping thickness, calculate the final Beam Camber Adjustment (Dt.x) at any point, x, along the length of the beam as follows:
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-169
Dt,x =  ��δnet,mid − δnet,x� �1 + ψ(t, ti)�� − ��δNC,mid + δC,mid� − �δNC,x + δC,x��
Where:
δnet,mid = Net camber at mid-span δnet,x  = Net camber at point x δNC,mid = Deflection due to non-composite
loading at mid-span
δC,mid = Deflection due to composite loading   at mid-span
δNC,x = Deflection at point x due to non-   composite loading
δC,x = Deflection at point x due to composite loading
ψ(t,ti) = Creep coefficient (Note: The equation shown for Dt,x assumes camber is upward and deflections are downward.)
To establish beam seat elevations, calculate the Beam Camber Adjustment using the creep coefficient at t equal to 30 days.
308.2.3.3.e.4 607BHAUNCH ADJUSTMENT (E) C308.2.3.3.e.4
The Haunch Adjustment is the portion of the Beam Camber Adjustment that can be utilized for Vertical Grade Adjustment in crest vertical curve profiles. This adjustment prevents the haunch from becoming excessive along the full length of the beam.
Calculate the Haunch Adjustment (E) as follows:
E = Bmid ≤ Max Dt,x
The Haunch Adjustment is equal to the Vertical Grade Adjustment at the beam midspan (Bmid) but cannot exceed the maximum value for Dt,x.
308.2.3.3.f 563BANCHORAGE
In a box beam design, anchor all beams at abutments and piers. Place the anchor at the center of the cross section of the box beam and conform to details presented in the Standard Bridge Drawing PSBD-2-07.
Install fixed end anchor dowels with a non-shrinking grout (mortar). Fill expansion end anchor dowel holes with joint sealer per C&amp;MS 705.04.
Install polystyrene, semi-rigid closed-cell polypropylene foam, or sponge rubber per C&amp;MS 705.03, the same thickness as the elastomeric bearing, under the box beam and around the anchor dowel to halt the grout or sealer from leaking through to the beam seat.

Provide and install tie rods according to the Bridge Standard Drawing PSBD-2-07.
Provide diaphragms and transverse tie rods for prestressed concrete box beam spans at mid-span for spans up to 50-ft, at third points for spans from 50-ft to 75-ft and at quarter points for spans greater than 75-ft.
308.2.3.4 444BI-BEAMS C308.2.3.4
Use AASHTO standard prestressed I-beam shapes, type II through type IV; modified type IV and WF36-49 through WF72-49 as shown in the standard bridge drawing PSID-1-13.
Refer to BDM Figure 308-6 for approximate maximum spans for each beam shape. The maximum spans provided may be used during the preliminary design of the structure to determine the approximate beam shape required.
Refer to BDM Section 304 for concrete and reinforcing material requirements for I-beam and the reinforced concrete deck.
Use a minimum of 4 prestressed I-beam stringer lines on bridge carrying vehicular traffic.
This provision is to avoid non-redundant structures.
Prestressed I-beam bridges that meet the vertical clearance specified in BDM Section 302.1 are acceptable over highway crossings.
In designing prestressed I-beams, use the non-composite section for computing stresses due to the beam and deck slab. Use the composite section for computing stresses due to the superimposed dead, railing and live loads.
When designing the deck reinforcement for a multiple span structure, model as a continuous beam on a single support centered on the pier.
For additional information see BDM Section 309.3.
Aside from access for shipping strands and clipped flanges as shown in the Bridge Standard Drawing PSID-1-13, do not place abrupt changes or discontinuities in the beam cross-section. If abrupt changes are not avoidable, a refined analysis that accounts for section loss, resulting stress concentrations, and time dependent loading is required.
When detailing beam elevations, dimension the locations of all inserts, hold-downs, etc. to the ends of the beam rather than the centerlines of bearing.
These dimensions are primarily for the prestressed beam fabricator and dimensioning from the end of the beam is a more practical work point for the fabricator.

H. Bond all strands within the horizontal limits of the web when the total number of debonded strands exceeds 25 percent.
I. Bond all strands within the horizontal limits of the web when the bottom flange to web width ratio exceeds 4.

To minimize the uplift force, locate the hold down point as close as allowed to the midspan and limit the height of the draped strands at the beam ends to only the height required to control stresses.
It is not necessary for the angle of inclination for each row of draped strands to be the same.
Detail the height of draped strands at beam ends and at midspan at multiples of 2-in.
Do not place straight strands above draped strands in the same vertical column.

The concrete topping thickness on prestressed I-beam superstructures will vary along the length of the beams to account for beam camber and other vertical elevation adjustments. Proper determination of the topping thickness is crucial in order to properly establish beam seat elevations.
As shown in BDM Figure 308-7, determine the concrete topping thickness (Tx) at any point, x, along the length of a prestressed I-beam superstructure by the following:
Tx = A + Bx + C + Dt,x - E Where:
A = Design deck thickness  Bx = Vertical grade adjustment
C = Sacrificial haunch depth  Dt,x = Beam camber adjustment at member age
equal to Day t
E = Haunch adjustment

Include additional haunch reinforcement when the haunch depth reaches 4-in. (Bx + C + Dt,x – E ≤ 4-in) for the sections shown in Bridge Standard Drawing PSID-1-13. Detail additional haunch reinforcement as shown in BDM Figure 308-8. Show the locations of the additional haunch reinforcement in the plans.
In order to ensure the entire haunch depth acts compositely with the beam and deck, additional reinforcement may be necessary to extend the beam’s composite reinforcement at least 2-in into the deck thickness.

308.2.3.4.b.1 611BVERTICAL GRADE ADJUSTMENT (Bx)
C308.2.3.4.b.1
Minimize the vertical grade adjustment along the length of the bridge by setting the linear grade between the beam ends parallel to the tangent of the vertical grade at the midpoint of the beam span (see BDM Figure 308-7).
The Vertical Grade Adjustment accounts for any elevation differences between a non-linear profile grade and the linear grade connecting the centerline of beam supports. The value of the Vertical Grade Adjustment depends on many geometric factors such as vertical curvature, skew, cross-slope transitions, etc.
308.2.3.4.b.2 612BSACRIFICIAL HAUNCH DEPTH (C)
C308.2.3.4.b.2
The purpose of the Sacrificial Haunch Depth is to account for camber in excess of that calculated in the Beam Camber Adjustment above and account for the roadway cross-slope.
Design the Sacrificial Haunch Depth (C) to be a minimum of 2-in.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-177
Detail the haunch so the 2-in minimum thickness, C, will occur at a flange edge. Show this requirement in the plans.
Because I-beams are set on level seats, the beams will be plumb after erection. The difference between the grades of the top flange and the cross-slope will be accommodated by the sacrificial haunch depth.
308.2.3.4.b.3 613B EAM CAMBER ADJUSTMENT (Dt,x)
C308.2.3.4.b.3
As prestressed concrete beams age, beam camber will increase due to concrete creep under the constant loading from the prestressing force. Although designers cannot accurately predict the girder age when the deck is placed, general assumptions can be made to prevent camber growth from becoming an issue during construction.
Show two values for camber at midspan in the design plans which the contractor can use to establish seat elevations according to C&amp;MS 511.07 and tolerance according to C&amp;MS 515.17: camber at Day 0 (D0) and camber at Day 30 (D30). These values represent the midspan camber in the beams before application of any dead load other than self-weight.
<em>To determine these camber values, calculate the creep coefficient, ψ(t,ti), according to LRFD 5.4.2.3.2 with humidity (H) equal to 70%; age of concrete at release (ti) equal to 0.75 days; and V/S and f′ci according to the project requirements. To calculate the creep coefficient at Day 0 and Day 30, use a maturity of concrete (t) equal to 0 days and 30 days respectively. The respective camber values are found by multiplying the net midspan camber at the time of release by the appropriate creep coefficient as follows:</em>
D30 = [1+ ψ(t,ti)] D0
The net camber at the time of release (δnet,x) is the difference between the initial beam camber due to the prestressing force (δo,x) and beam deflection due to self-weight (δsw,x) [i.e. δnet,x = δo,x - δsw,x].
The gross moment of inertia for the non-composite I-beam may be used to determine δo,x and δsw,x.
For the purposes of determining the topping thickness, calculate the final Beam Camber Adjustment (Dt.x) at any point, x, along the length of the beam as follows:
Dt,x =  ��δnet,mid − δnet,x� �1 + ψ(t, ti)�� − ��δNC,mid + δC,mid� − �δNC,x + δC,x��
Where:
δnet,mid = Net camber at mid-span δnet,x  = Net camber at point x δNC,mid = Deflection due to non-composite
loading at mid-span
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-178
δC,mid = Deflection due to composite loading   at mid-span
δNC,x = Deflection at point x due to non-   composite loading
δC,x = Deflection at point x due to composite  loading
ψ(t,ti) = Creep coefficient (Note: The equation shown for Dt,x assumes camber is upward and deflections are downward.)
To establish beam seat elevations, calculate the Beam Camber Adjustment using the creep coefficient at t equal to 30 days.
308.2.3.4.b.4 614BHAUNCH ADJUSTMENT (E) C308.2.3.4.b.4
The Haunch Adjustment is the portion of the Beam Camber Adjustment that can be utilized for Vertical Grade Adjustment in crest vertical curve profiles only. This adjustment prevents the haunch from becoming excessive along the full length of the beam.
Calculate the Haunch Adjustment (E) as follows:
E = Bmid ≤ Max Dt,x
The Haunch Adjustment is equal to the Vertical Grade Adjustment at the beam midspan (Bmid) but cannot exceed the maximum value for Dt,x.
308.2.3.4.c 567BANCHORAGE
Provide 1-in. diameter anchors at each fixed pier as shown on bridge standard drawing PSID-1-13.
Determine the required number of anchors by analysis. Design the anchors to transfer superstructure loads to the substructure at the Strength Limit States and resist seismic loads at Extreme Event Limit State.
Use anchors with a minimum length of 2-ft. Embed the anchors a minimum of 1-ft into the pier cap. Post install (drill and grout) the anchors at the centerline of at the pier. Confirm the pier cap has concrete reinforcement clearance to accept these anchors.

Intermediate diaphragms for 60-in and deeper beams shall be either cast-in-place concrete or galvanized steel. The contractor shall choose the type. Intermediate diaphragms for less than 60-in deep beams shall be cast-in-place concrete. Details for each type are provided in the standard bridge drawing. The design plans shall show the centerline location of each intermediate diaphragm. The Department will pay for the intermediate diaphragms at the contract price for ITEM 515 - EACH, INTERMEDIATE DIAPHRAGMS.

Show the top of the cast-in-place intermediate diaphragm at the bottom vertical edge of the top flange and the bottom of the cast-in-place intermediate diaphragm at the top of the vertical edge of the bottom flange.
Contact with the intermediate diaphragm could act as a support to the deck, causing cracking and possible over stressing of the deck.
Refer to Bridge Standard Drawing PSID-1-13 for additional details on cast-in-place intermediate diaphragms.
If the Standard Bridge Drawing for I-beams is not referenced by the contract plans, add a note to the plans for prestressed I-beam designs requiring cast-in-place intermediate diaphragms to be placed and cured at least 48 hours before deck placement.
Use threaded inserts to connect the concrete reinforcement for the cast-in-place diaphragm to the I-beam. Galvanize the threaded inserts and the threaded rods according to C&amp;MS 711.02.
Provide cast-in-place end diaphragms. Detail the end diaphragm to make complete contact with the deck. End the bottom limits of the end diaphragm at the top of the elastomeric bearing.

309.3.3.1 445BSCREED ELEVATIONS C309.3.3.1
Do not include adjustment for deflections due to the future wearing surface loading in screed elevations. Assume a completed placement sequence to calculate deflections caused by the weight of the deck concrete. Use deflection data from girder lines closest to each screed line to determine elevations. Refer to BDM Figure 309-6.
Screed elevations are control elevations for concrete deck finishing machines that account for dead load deflections to ensure that the bridge deck is completed to the correct elevation. To establish screed elevations, the final surface elevations are adjusted for non-composite deflections resulting from deck placement and composite deflections resulting from utility and railing loads.
If the deflections are determined through a line girder analysis method, distribute the deck load evenly to all beams/girders loaded in each construction phase to establish screed elevations. If a refined analysis method is used, establish screed elevations using the individual beam/girder deflections.
Include a screed elevations table in the bridge plans. Identify the locations of all screed elevations in the table on a transverse section and plan view. Provide elevations for all: curblines or deck edges; profile grade points; transverse grade-break lines; and phased construction lines for the full length of the bridge. Screed elevations are not required above beam/girder lines. Detail bearing points, quarter-span points, mid-span points and splice points as well as any additional points required to meet a maximum spacing between points of 25-ft.
For bridges with a separate wearing course, give the elevations at the top of the portland cement concrete deck. Provide a plan note stating at what surface the elevations are given.
When calculating screed elevations for composite box beam bridges, provide the same requirements as steel beam, girder and prestressed I-beam bridges.
Screed elevations are not required for non-composite box beam bridges or slab bridges.

Identify the top of haunch elevation locations in a plan view and on the transverse section. Provide a plan note for a definition and description of the purpose for the top of haunch elevations (see BDM Section 702.12.2). Refer to BDM Figure 309-6.
Top of haunch elevations represent the theoretical bottom of deck elevation before the concrete deck is placed.

309.3.4 272BREINFORCEMENT
309.3.4.1 448BLONGITUDINAL C309.3.4.1
On reinforced concrete decks for steel or concrete stringers, design the secondary reinforcement in the top-reinforcing layer to be a minimum of 1/3 the main reinforcement, spaced uniformly.
Detail the secondary bar size as a #4. The only exception to this requirement is if the bar spacing becomes less than 3-in.
Research has shown that secondary bars in the top mat of reinforced concrete bridge decks on stringers should be small bars at close spacing.
For stringer type bridges with reinforced concrete decks, place the secondary bars above the top of deck primary bars.
This helps in reducing shrinkage cracking and adds additional cover over the primary bars.
<em>For steel or concrete stringers, meet the requirements of LRFD 6.10.1.7 for the longitudinal reinforcement over a pier. Stagger every other reinforcing bar over the pier 3-ft longitudinally.</em>
309.3.4.2 449BTRANSVERSE C309.3.4.2
Place the top and bottom main reinforcement in transversely reinforced deck slabs at equal spaces to coincide in a vertical plane.
This requirement is to help facilitate the placement of concrete reinforcement and concrete.
Bridges with a skew equal to or greater than 15-degrees or where the transverse reinforcing will interfere with the shear studs, place the transverse reinforcement perpendicular to the centerline of the bridge. Refer to Standard Bridge Drawing CS-1-24 or SB-1-24 for the requirements on slab bridges.
For steel beam or girder bridges with a skew of less than 15-degrees the transverse reinforcing may be shown placed parallel to the abutments.
For phased constructed bridges where mechanical connectors will be required placing the bars parallel to the centerline of bearing should be avoided.
For prestressed I-beams, place transverse reinforcing perpendicular to the centerline of the bridge.
For composite box beam decks, place the transverse concrete reinforcement parallel to the abutment.
For steel beam or girder bridges, check the clearance of the bottom transverse bars over the top of bolted beam splice plates or moment plates.
Reinforcing bars at a skew generally cannot be placed between bolt heads.
309.3.5 273BHAUNCHED DECK REQUIREMENTS

When the roadway break point is located at the edge of pavement (adjacent shoulder width is equal to or greater than 4-ft and less than 8-ft), use a 4-ft rounding distance from the edge of lane onto the shoulder to transition from the bridge cross slope to the 1/2-in. per ft. shoulder cross slope. See “CASE c” in BDM Figure 309-10.
D.  When the roadway break point is located at the edge of pavement (adjacent shoulder width is equal to or greater than 8-ft), use a 5-ft rounding distance from the edge of lane onto the shoulder to transition from the bridge cross slope to the 1/2-in. per ft. shoulder cross slope. See “CASE d” in BDM Figure 309-10.
If the change in cross slope at the superelevation break point is less than or equal to 7 percent, then no rounding is required.

Provide a transition diagram in the plans, similar to what is shown in BDM Figure 309-11. In lieu of the diagram, a table with the transition information shown in BDM Figure 309-11 is also acceptable.
Because of the complexities associated with superelevation transitions on bridge superstructures (e.g. beam and girder cambering, cross-frame fabrication, deck form construction, slip forming of concrete bridge railing, etc.) all reasonable attempts should be made to keep such transitions off of bridge decks. Where transitions are located on bridge decks, the transitions should be straight. Where this is not possible, the transition’s discontinuities should be smoothed by inserting 50-ft roundings at each discontinuity.

309.3.8 276BCONCRETE DECK PLACEMENT CONSIDERATIONS
C309.3.8
Mechanized finishing machines are preferred to hand finishing methods for both consistency of surface finish and economics. Designers should be aware of finishing machine limitations in order to avoid deck designs that require hand finishing methods.
The placement of deck concrete using mechanized finishing machines alone does not ensure a smooth riding surface. Achieving a smooth riding surface as well as ensuring the proper geometry of the concrete deck is further complicated by deflections of the concrete falsework and of the main structural support members during the placement operation. The Contractor is responsible for designing falsework and finishing machine support to minimize deflection during placement, but the Designer is responsible for deflections induced by deck placement on the superstructure. Many complications due to deflection during placement can be avoided with proper design considerations.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-197
309.3.8.1 451BFINISHING MACHINES C309.3.8.1
Mechanized finishing machines are comprised of fabricated truss sections pinned together to span the bridge deck width to be paved. The truss spans are supported at each end on a set of wheels, called “bogies,” which ride along the length of the bridge on screed rails. Suspended below the truss is a finishing head, called a “carriage,” which levels, compacts, vibrates and finishes the concrete. See BDM Figure 309-12 .
Figure 309-12
Finishing machines can be placed such that the truss sections are skewed with respect to the screed rails. This orientation allows for concrete placement parallel to the substructure skew as required by the C&amp;MS 511. For skew angles of 15-degrees and greater, the finishing machine can be skewed to within 5-degrees of the plan specified skew angle.
The carriage can also be skewed with respect to the truss sections. This feature allows the carriage to finish the concrete transverse to the bridge when the truss sections are placed at some other orientation (e.g. parallel to the substructure skew). To ensure a proper finish at transverse grade breaks (e.g. crown points), the carriage should always be oriented to finish the concrete transverse to the bridge. A special length truss section insert is required above the grade break locations such that the grade break line lies directly below opposite corners of the section. For skewed bridges without transverse grade breaks, skewing the carriage with respect to the truss sections is not required. (See BDM Figure 309-13)
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-198
Figure 309-13
Most finishing machines do not easily accommodate non-parallel rails. The distance between the screed rails should be a fixed width. Designs that require tapered paving widths should be avoided.
The finishing machines can be hinged at the pin connections between truss sections to provide transverse grade breaks (e.g. crown points). In theory, multiple transverse grade breaks can be accommodated, but the grade breaks must remain at a fixed spacing to line up with a pin connection. The BDM Figure 309-14 illustrates the complexity of the machine set-up to accommodate multiple grade breaks in a transverse section placed on a skew. Note that the length of truss sections required between grade breaks must fit the standard truss section lengths.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025

Figure 309-14
Avoid grade break locations that move laterally along the length of the bridge.
This arrangement cannot be paved in a single operation using a mechanized finishing machine. The only way this is possible is with the use of a phase construction deck. Note that as the machine progresses forward, the truss hinge locations and the grade break locations no longer coincide. See BDM Figure 309-15.

309.3.8.2 452BSOURCES OF GIRDER TWIST C309.3.8.2
Fully install cross-frames/diaphragms prior to deck placement.
The interconnectivity between girders, intermediate cross-frames/diaphragms and end cross-frames /diaphragms is essential to a structure’s stability throughout the construction process. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to ensure that all cross-frames/diaphragms are fully installed prior to deck placement. Failure to do so may lead to construction disputes, expensive repairs and lengthy construction delays or even impact project safety. One major drawback to this interconnectivity is that the deflection caused by the placement of the concrete deck will result in girder twisting.
There are primarily three independent sources of girder twist resulting from deck placement. This manual will refer to these sources as:  global superstructure distortion, oil-canning and girder warping.
309.3.8.2.a 570BGLOBAL SUPERSTRUCTURE DISTORTION
C309.3.8.2.a
Global superstructure distortion is distortion of the bridge transverse section primarily caused by differential deflections between adjacent girders. As a girder deflects downward with respect to an adjacent girder, the rigidity of the cross framing between the two girders causes the deflecting girder to rotate as it deflects. This distortion may occur with both steel and prestressed concrete superstructures. The most common differential deflections occur between the exterior girders and adjacent interior girders for a given construction phase when the loaded tributary areas over the girders differ.
Transverse sections with more heavily loaded exterior girders distort in a convex shape. Refer to BDM Figure 309-16.
Figure 309-16
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-201
Transverse sections with more heavily loaded interior girders distort in a concave shape. Refer to BDM Figure 309-17.
Figure 309-17
Twisting of the exterior girders can result in deck thickness and cover loss if the screed rails are supported on cantilevered falsework. The magnitude of girder twist (measured as ϕg) will vary over the length of the bridge and will be different for the left and right sides if loading or geometry is not symmetrical. See BDM Figure 309-18.
Figure 309-18
For a new superstructure, calculate the amount of girder twist due to global superstructure deformation when the tributary deck load carried by the fascia girder exceeds 110% of the average of the tributary deck load carried by the interior members for a given construction phase.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-202
For an existing superstructure, calculate the amount of girder twist due to global superstructure deformation when the tributary deck load carried by the fascia girder exceeds 115 % of the average of the tributary deck load carried by the interior members for a given construction phase. See BDM Figure 309-19.
Figure 309-19
When the aforementioned tributary deck loading requirements of the fascia members are met, perform a refined analysis of the superstructure system to determine the magnitude of fascia girder twist (ϕg) due to deck concrete placement.
To properly calculate the effect of the twist angle on deck thickness, the analysis should be based on the deflection occurring due to the concrete present at the time that the finishing machine passes over the point under consideration. This degree of precision requires a separate refined analysis for each point of consideration. It is generally sufficient to calculate ϕg based on the full wet concrete load placed over the entire structure. However, on complex structures with variable skews and/or curved girders, a higher degree of precision may be warranted to ensure proper deck thickness.
Additional measures to reduce global deformation include adding or stiffening the cross-frames/ diaphragms; and increasing the stiffness of the girders. An increase in the cross-frame stiffness results in better load distribution across the width of the structure and less distortion. An increase in the stiffness of the girders reduces the magnitude of vertical deflection resulting in less distortion of the transverse section.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-203
309.3.8.2.b 571BOIL-CANNING C309.3.8.2.b
Distortion due to oil-canning occurs when large lateral loads from the cantilevered deck slab falsework bracket deform the girder web. See BDM Figure 309-20.
Figure 309-20
Locating the falsework bracket near the bottom flange will reduce the amount of web deformation. C&amp;MS Item 508 requires the lower point of contact to be within 8-in of the top of the bottom flange. Given this requirement and the geometric capabilities of the falsework brackets, the magnitude of girder twist (ϕo) resulting from oil-canning may be neglected for girder webs 84-in deep or less.
For web depths greater than 84-in, provide the location of the falsework bracket in the plans. Provide a General Note that removes the lower point of contact requirement of C&amp;MS Item 508 (see BDM Section 611.4.1 for an example). Specify the pay item for deck concrete as “as per plan”. Using the plan bracket location, determine ϕo. Detail any temporary bracing in the plans.
Designers may assume the lowest location of the falsework bracket to be 76-in measured below the bottom of the top flange. The magnitude of twist can be predicted using finite element analysis of the web or by various approximate methods. If the magnitude results in excessive deck thickness loss, reducing the transverse stiffener spacing or adding temporary bracing on the inside of the web may be necessary.
The magnitude of girder twist resulting from oil-canning may be neglected for prestressed I-beam superstructures.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-204
309.3.8.2.c 572BGIRDER WARPING C309.3.8.2.c
Distortion due to girder warping occurs as a result of deck slab overhang falsework loading on the fascia girder between points of lateral bracing (e.g. cross-frames). The bracket loads produce twist between the cross-frames due to a combination of girder warping and pure torsional distortion (See BDM Figure 309-21). The girder is restrained from warping at the cross-frame locations. Due to the inherent torsional stiffness of prestressed I-beams, the distortion due to girder warping may be neglected. Other design considerations for I-beams due to the overhang bracket loadings are presented at the end of this section.
Figure 309-21
For steel superstructures, calculate the magnitude of twist (ϕw) due girder warping.
The TAEG (“Torsional Analysis of Exterior Girders”) software developed by the Kansas Department of Transportation. TAEG is available at no cost and can be downloaded at:  <a href="https://kart.ksdot.org/">https://kart.ksdot.org/</a>.
For design-build projects and value engineering change proposals (VECP’s), represent the actual falsework and equipment to be used by the contractor in the data input for girder warping analysis.
Since most of the data input in the girder warping analysis is dependent upon the contractor’s equipment and falsework design, designers should use conservative assumptions to accommodate most contractor resources.
Designers may use the following assumptions in lieu of actual contractor supplied information:
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-205
A. Girder Data:  For bridges with constant web depths, designers
may select the cross section with the least torsional resistance to represent the entire structure. For bridges with variable depth webs, designers may disregard the effect of girder warping in the web depth transition sections.
Detail any temporary tie rods and timber blocks in the contract plans.
B. Bridge Lateral Data:  Designers may select the largest cross-frame
spacing to represent the entire structure. For structures with variable beam spacings (i.e. flared girders) designers may select the largest spacing dimension to represent the entire structure. Designers should generally avoid utilizing temporary tie rods and timber blocks.
C. Permanent Lateral Support Data:  The default cross-frame type assumed by the TAEG
software consists of a stiffener and diagonal x-bracing with top and bottom horizontal chords. In order to analyze the structure with a standard ODOT cross-frame, designers should input stiffener dimensions and select the “Diaphragms (Inputted Ix)” option. For ODOT standard cross-frames, designers should assume a fictitious stiffener of dimensions: 5-in x 3/8-in. Determine the diaphragm moment of inertia for all standard ODOT cross-frames as shown in BDM Figure 309-22.
Figure 309-22
D. Temporary Lateral Support Data:
Designers should generally avoid utilizing temporary tie rods and timber blocks; however, if required these should be detailed in the contract plans.

To estimate the total finishing machine length required for placement along the skew, add the rail-to-rail length and the extra end length from the following table using the plan specified skew rounded to the nearest 5-degrees.

309.3.8.3 453BDETERMINING EFFECT OF GIRDER TWIST
C309.3.8.3
Once all sources of girder twist are quantified, determine the total effect that girder twist has on the finished deck surface.
Do not exceed 1/2-in cover loss due to girder twist. The greatest concern in girder twist is the loss of concrete cover over the top mat of deck reinforcement and the subsequent loss of deck thickness.
Determine the total amount of girder twist at both the left and right screed rails as follows:
ϕleft = (ϕg + ϕo + ϕw)left   AND
ϕright = (ϕg + ϕo + ϕw)right
Where:
ϕg = Girder twist due to global superstructure  distortion (See BDM Section  309.3.8.2.a)
ϕo = Girder twist due to “oil-canning” (See  BDM  Section 309.3.8.2.b)
ϕw = Girder twist due to girder warping (See  BDM Section 309.3.8.2.c)
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025

Determine the total amount of screed rail deflection at both the left and right screed rail as follows: (See BDM Figure 309-25)
Figure 309-25
δleft = tan(ϕleft) x Lb   AND
δright = tan(ϕright) x Lb
Where: δleft, δright = Deflection of the screed rail due
to total girder twist (in). Upward    deflection is positive and     downward deflection is negative.
Lb = Lateral distance from center of screed rail  to centerline of fascia girder (in)
Determine the total loss of deck thickness as follows:
δTotal = (δleft + δright)/2
309.3.8.4 454BSLAB DEPTH OF CURVED BRIDGES
C309.3.8.4
For a curved deck on straight steel beams, steel girders or prestressed I-beams, the distance from the top of the slab to the top of the beams or girders will vary from end to end. Show this variation in the slab depth dimension by giving the maximum and minimum depth dimensions with their respective location, over the piers, center of span, etc.
An alternate is to accommodate the differential depth by including it in the Camber Table as geometric camber.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025

309.3.8.5 455BSTAGED CONSTRUCTION C309.3.8.5
For bridges with a cast-in-place concrete deck on steel beam/girders or prestressed I-beams, where the differential dead load deflection between adjacent phases at any point along the span is greater than 1/4-in, a full-length deck closure pour is required.
For the purposes of determining differential deflection, consider the amount of relative vertical movement due to the weight of the deck placement between any point along the beam centerline nearest the phase construction line and its relative point along a radial line at the edge of the previous stage edge of deck. This movement can conservatively be estimated as the deflection of the beam nearest the phase line due to the weight of the deck concrete. For example, if the deck dead load deflection of the beam nearest the phase line is 1-in at midspan, then the differential dead load deflection between phases at the midpoint is 1-in. For a more refined analysis, this movement can be determined as the remaining deck dead load deflection of the beam nearest the phase line at the point of concrete placement. For example, if the total deck deflection at the first quarter point is 1-in, but when the deck concrete is loaded to the first quarter point, the beam deflection is 0.25-in., then the remaining differential deflection between phases at the first quarter point is 0.75-in.
For slab bridges built with phased construction, a deck closure pour is required regardless of the differential deflection magnitude. Remove the falsework at the completion of each phase of construction and before completing the closure pour.
This closure pour is required to avoid over-stressing the top transverse concrete reinforcement and also avoid increasing the width of the construction joint when the falsework is removed from the latter phase of construction. Avoid a solution to this issue that requires falsework for all phases to be left in place; removed at the completion of slab construction and designed for live load.
For composite box beam bridges with phased construction, a deck closure pour is required regardless of the differential deflection magnitude. Do not place the grout for the shear key in the closure pour until the deck on both sides of the closure pour are completed.
Refer to BDM Figure 309-26 for an example composite box beam deck transverse section showing staged construction.
Figure 309-26
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-211
The minimum closure pour width between the stages is 30-in. When the transverse reinforcing is being lap spliced, detail the width of the closure pour to accommodate the required concrete reinforcement lap splices.
When mechanical connectors are utilized, use a mechanical connector system in accordance with C&amp;MS 509.
Do not permanently attach intermediate cross-frames and diaphragms attached in the closure pour location until the concrete pours on both sides of the closure pour location have been completed.
The preferred location for staged construction joints is the positive moment regions of the cast-in-place concrete deck slab.
Provide plan notes on the stage construction details sheet that detail the sequence of construction.

C309.5.3
For structures without sidewalks, the minimum fence height is 8-ft above the pavement surface. For structures with sidewalks, the minimum fence height is 8-ft above the sidewalk.
For curved fence, extend the post vertically for at least 8-ft above the sidewalk before curving inward over the sidewalk. Construct the overhang at least 1-ft less than the width of the sidewalk. See BDM Figure 309-27 &amp; Figure 309-28.
For a greater degree of protection against objects being thrown from the bridge, the fence may be curved to overhang the sidewalk.
For pedestrian bridges, use bent pipe frames with pipe bend radii of 24-in at the upper corners and start the radii at least 8-ft above the sidewalk surface. Start the fabric at the deck line, top of curb or concrete bridge railing and extend to at least the top of the bent portion of the frame.
Omitting fabric on the top horizontal area of the frame may prevent an individual from walking on the top of the enclosure. See BDM Figure 309-29 for an illustration of this configuration. Alternatively, the frame may be designed to form a peak at the center of the structure, similar to a house roofline.
Install the fence a maximum of 1-in above the top of the concrete bridge railing.
Locate baseplates so that the adhesive anchors are a minimum of 1.5 times the post-installed anchor embedment from the deflection joint of the railing
Install posts and frames either plumb or perpendicular to the longitudinal grade of the bridge, subject to considerations of aesthetics or practicality of construction. For non-standard systems, show the posts and frames orientation with respect to the longitudinal grade in the plans. Provide complete details of base plates, pipe inserts or other types of base anchorage in the plans.
VPF-1-90 is shown as plumb to the longitudinal grade.
Extend the fencing between end posts placed at the locations selected from the following list that creates the shortest length:
A. 30-ft ± 2.5-ft beyond the route under bridge edge of traveled way nearest the fence terminal

309.5.6 286BTEMPORARY VANDAL PROTECTION FENCING
C309.5.6
Use the Design Data Sheet, TVPFDD-1-18, Temporary Vandal Protection Fencing to determine the fencing requirements on bridges during construction.
The intent of temporary vandal protection fencing is to discourage pedestrians from dropping or throwing heavy objects off the side of the bridge onto traffic below during construction.
Standard Bridge Drawing, TVPF-1-18, Temporary Vandal Protection Fencing, provides details for:
A. Type A – Fencing installed on existing railing
systems and on the existing deck surface near the phased construction joint
B. Type B – Fencing installed on the back side of the PCB. Refer to BDM Section 309.4.3.6 for PCB anchoring requirements. As a minimum, provide at least one anchor per PCB segment on the traffic side of the barrier.
C. Type C – Fencing installed along the phased construction joint side of a newly constructed deck.
Detail the length of the temporary vandal protection fencing installation in accordance with the minimum lengths defined in BDM Section 309.5.3.
The Department will utilize permanent vandal protection fencing where possible to minimize costs for temporary fencing. Therefore, place new permanent fence installations prior to shifting traffic onto that phase of construction. Leave temporary vandal protection fencing installed on existing concrete railing in place until the concrete railing is removed from the bridge. Leave all other types of temporary vandal protection fencing in place until the Engineer determines that it is no longer necessary. Once removed, reinstallation of temporary vandal protection fencing is not required.
In the plans provide pay item(s) in the Estimated Quantities; show the limits and location of each temporary vandal protection fencing installation; and show the appropriate temporary vandal protection fencing type on the Maintenance of Traffic Transverse Sections. If necessary, provide all non-standard connection and fence details in the plans; address special installation sequencing; and include all other special notes. Provide details for temporary vandal protection fencing across intermediate expansion joints.

BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-229
Design the modular devices main load bearing beams, support beams and welds for fatigue.
Design of support for the modular device and deck thickness should allow for multiple styles or designs of modular devices. Contact suppliers and become familiar with the modular devices available.
309.6.2.5 478BTOOTH TYPE, FINGER TYPE OR NON-STANDARD SLIDING PLATE EXPANSION DEVICES
C309.6.2.5
Finger or sliding plate joints are another alternative type of expansion device where movements exceed the capacity of either strip or compression seal devices. This type of expansion device generally competes against Modular joints. Their advantage is their simplicity of design. Their disadvantage is their inability to seal against intrusion of water and debris.
Use of a tooth type expansion device also requires neoprene drainage troughs and a suitable drainage system to carry away the water. Completely detail both the neoprene trough and downspout to drainage trough connection. Pay special attention to developing a complete seal at the downspout to trough connection. Vulcanize the down spout to the trough.
Design finger devices for fatigue.
Do not design finger devices with fracture critical components.
Use pre-qualified 513 Level UF fabricators to construct finger or sliding plate devices.

309.7 101B RIDGE DECK DRAINAGE C309.7
When using concrete bridge railing, provide a minimum longitudinal grade of 0.3% across the entire length of the bridge deck surface.
Minimize or eliminate scuppers used for collecting the deck surface drainage.
Scupper should be eliminated on existing structure when feasible.
Compute the allowable spread of flow using the procedures described in Section 1103 of the L&amp;D, Vol. 2 to determine if scuppers are required.
Scuppers when provided, should preferably be located inside the fascia beam.
Slope drainage collection systems as steeply as practical, and not less than 15-degrees from horizontal. The minimum bend radius for the system is 18-in, and no 90-degree bends are permitted. Provide adequate pipe supports and cleanouts at the low ends of runs.
The cleanout plugs should be easily and safely accessible.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-231
Place scuppers with drainage collection as closely as possible to the substructure unit which drains them. Locate and detail the drainage collection system in the plans. Place uncollected scupper downspouts as far away as possible from the substructure.
When the deck drainage is to flow off the ends of the bridge, make provisions to collect and carry away this run-off. Refer to the L&amp;D, Vol. 2, Section 1103.8 for more information.
Control of drainage is especially critical at abutments with MSE walls. On structures with MSE walls at the abutments, provide a concrete bridge railing on the approach slab with a standard inlet, SCD I-3D to collect the drainage. Locate the inlet at least 25-ft beyond the limits of the MSE wall soil reinforcement and continue concrete barrier 10-ft past the catch basin. Refer to BDM Figure 309-30 for more information.
For bridges with over-the-side drainage, provide a stainless steel drip strip to protect the deck edge and beam fascia from the deck surface run-off.

310.4 106BUTILITIES C310.4
Make the request to allow utilities on the bridge through the ODOT District Utilities Coordinator. Install utilities in substantial ducts or enclosures adequate to protect the lines from future bridge repair and maintenance operations.
The type of superstructure selected for a site may be dependent upon the number of utilities supported on the bridge.
Do not place utilities inside of prestressed concrete box beams.
If the bridge design is a composite deck on prestressed box beams, the design may either eliminate an interior box beam or provide a space between two interior box beams to provide utility access in this space. This alternative will require a special design for both the box beams and the deck.
When it is necessary to place a utility, storm sewer trunk line, or culvert through, beneath or within a 10-ft radius of the limits of the select granular backfill of an MSE wall, encase it in steel casing pipe according to C&amp;MS 748.06.
Placing utilities, storm sewers and culverts through, beneath or within a 10-ft radius of the select granular backfill of an MSE wall should be avoided.
When it is necessary to place a storm sewer within the limits of the select granular backfill of an MSE wall, provide reinforced concrete pipe according to C&amp;MS 706.02. Provide premium joints according to C&amp;MS 706.11 and wrap the pipe joints in geotextile fabric, Type A according to C&amp;MS 712.09.
Show and dimension utility conduits embedded in concrete to clear construction joints by a minimum of 1-in and other conduits by a minimum of 2-in.
Do not embedded utilities in the actual vehicular traffic carrying section of a concrete deck.

310.5 107BAESTHETICS
310.5.1 294BGENERAL C310.5.1
Refer to the ODOT Aesthetic Design Guidelines for aesthetics treatments on structures.
Each structure should be evaluated for aesthetics. Normally it is not practical to provide cost premium aesthetic treatments without a specific demand; however careful attention to the details of the structure lines and forms will generally result in a pleasing structure appearance.
Some basic guidelines that should be considered are as follows:
A.  Avoid mixing structural elements, for example concrete slab and steel beam superstructures or cap and column piers with wall type piers.
B.  In general, continuous superstructures shall be provided for multiple span bridges. Where intermediate joints cannot be avoided, the depth of spans adjacent to the joints preferably should be the same. Avoid the use of very slender superstructures over massive piers.
C.  Abrupt changes in beam depth should be avoided when possible. Whenever sudden changes in the depth of the beams in adjacent spans are required, care should be taken in the development of details at the pier.
D.  The lines of the structure should be simple and without excessive curves and abrupt changes.
E.  All structures should blend in with their surroundings.
The most significant design factors contributing to the aesthetic quality of the structure is unity, consistency, and continuity. These qualities will give the structure an appearance of a design process that was carefully thought out.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-237
The aesthetics of the structure can generally be accomplished within the guidelines of design requiring only minimum special designs and minor project cost increase.
If formliners are being considered, the depth of the projections should be as deep as possible in order to have the desired visual effect. Using shallow depths, such as 2-in to 3-in, provides very little, if any, visual effect (relief) when viewed from a distance. The depth of the formliner shall not be included in the measurement of the concrete clear cover.
The use of colored concrete, where the color is integral with the concrete mix, should generally not be used since the final visual appearance of the concrete is not uniform. The color varies greatly due to the aggregate, cement type, cement content and the curing of the concrete. None of these items are reasonably controlled in the field to a sufficient enough degree to ensure a uniform final appearance. If color is required, a concrete coating should be used which will not only produce the required color but will also provide the necessary sealing of the concrete as required in BDM Sections 306.1.2 and 309.2.1.
The use of formliners and/or coloring of the concrete should be evaluated on a cost basis and submitted as part of the Structure Type Study, Cost Analysis.
310.5.2 295BLETTERING AND LOGO POLICY ON ODOT FACILITIES
C310.5.2
Obtain approval from the Office of Structural Engineering for all lettering and logos to be placed on a
bridge. Obtain approval from the Office of Environmental Services for all lettering and logos to be
placed on noise walls. Obtain approval from the Division of Innovative Delivery for all lettering and
logos to be placed on ODOT facilities through sponsorship naming proposals.
Office of Structural Engineering approval of a lettering and logo submission does not constitute acceptance of the structural design. Structural design acceptance will occur through the review processes defined in BDM Section 200.
Aesthetic lighting shall be in accordance with the ODOT TEM note 1142-26.
The owner of the bridge should consider obtaining a written agreement regarding operating costs and maintenance responsibilities with local agency requesting the lettering or logo enhancements.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-238
The criteria for permitting lettering and logos on Bridges and Noise Walls is as follows:
A. City names and City logos are acceptable provided the bridge or noise wall is within the territorial jurisdiction of that City.
B. County names and County logos are acceptable provided the bridge or noise wall is within the territorial jurisdiction of that County.
C. Street names and Path names are acceptable provided the bridge carries that public street or public path. Private street names or private path names are not permissible.
D. Obtain FHWA acceptance, if necessary.
The local agency requesting the lettering or logo may be required to fund the additional cost over what ODOT would normally install on the bridge or noise wall.
A. ODOT traditionally uses standard concrete form liners on bridges and noise walls. If the lettering or logo will require additional or custom concrete form liners, the cost over a standard concrete form liner may be required to be secured/funded by the local agency.
B. ODOT traditionally places vandal protection fencing on bridges. If the lettering or logo will require non-standard fence or supports, the cost over the standard fence may be required to be secured/funded by the local agency.
E. Lettering or logos shall not extend above the top of bridge railing or fence. Lettering or logos shall not extend below the normal lines of the bridge superstructure.
F. Lettering or logos on bridge substructure units shall be within the normal limits of those units. Do not add extraneous elements for the sole purpose of displaying lettering or logos.
G. Provide 5 copies of rendering(s) of the proposal with the request.
310.6 108BRAILWAY BRIDGES C310.6
Contact the Ohio Rail Development Commission (ORDC) for assistance with railroad-roadway coordination including overpass design requirements.
Ohio&#39;s largest railroads, CSX and Norfolk Southern, publish Public Project Manuals to assist public entities in interacting with their organizations.  Regional and short-line railroads often publish information on their websites to identify appropriate processes and contacts. Links to CSX and Norfolk Southern Public Project Manuals are available on the ORDC website.
For railway overpasses the specific requirements of the railway company involved need to be addressed. The design and operational requirements of the railway companies will vary from railway line to railway line and between companies. Some of the common railway concerns are as follows:
A.  Horizontal and vertical clearances for both the final proposed design and during construction,
B.  The constructability of the substructure units adjacent to their tracks,
C.  Allowing adequate clearances for drainage ditches and access roads that are parallel to their tracks,
D.  Location of railway utilities, and E.  Provisions for crash walls on piers.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-239
Drainage from the bridge should be collected in drain pipes and drained away from the railway right of way
When temporary shoring details are required for construction of substructure units adjacent to railway tracks, include details in the plans. When considering excavation for substructure units, address whether sheet piling can be driven (avoid existing footing, clear any battered piles, elevation of bedrock, etc.) and whether the proper lengths can be provided to retain the railway tracks. Do not allow settlement of the tracks to occur.
Interlocking sheet piling of cantilever design is preferred. It may be appropriate to leave the temporary shoring in place after construction.
310.7 109B ICYCLE BRIDGES C310.7
<em>For new structures, the minimum bridge width shall be the same as the width of the paved bicycle path and approach shoulders. Use a minimum transverse slope of 1/4 in per foot sloped in one direction. Provide bicycle railings at a minimum of 3.5-ft high. For the design of the railing refer to AASHTO LRFD Article 13.9. If an occasional maintenance vehicle is going to use the bridge, design the railing as only a bicycle railing. Use bicycle safe bridge deck joints.</em>

312 19BREDUNDANCY C312
The purpose of this section is to provide policy and commentary for the classification of members as redundant or non-redundant. When members are deemed to not have load path redundancy, the sections concerning system redundancy and internal redundancy offer options on how to redesignate members previously classified as an NSTM. These provisions may be utilized to analyze and designate of both existing and proposed members.
For additional information regarding the inspection requirements of these members, refer to the Ohio Manual of Bridge Inspection (OMBI).
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025

Historically, only load path redundancy has been considered when determining a member’s redundancy and subsequent design, fabrication and inspection requirements. However, two additional forms of redundancy were introduced in the National Bridge Inspection Standards (NBIS) in 2022. These new classifications for redundancy afford designers the ability to characterize steel tension members that would have previously been considered nonredundant as redundant if it can be proven, through analysis, that the member is redundant. This section will cover the necessary resources and analysis procedures required to determine a member’s redundancy in terms of load path redundant, system redundant, internally redundant, or nonredundant
The NBIS defines Load Path, System, and Internal Redundancy as follows:
Load Path Redundancy: A redundancy exists based on the number of primary load-carrying members such that fracture of the cross section at one location of a member will not cause a portion of or the entire bridge to collapse.
System Redundancy: A redundancy that exists in a bridge system without load path redundancy, such that fracture of the cross section at one location of a primary member will not cause a portion of or the entire bridge to collapse.
Internal Redundancy: A redundancy that exists within a primary member cross-section without load path redundancy, such that fracture of one component will not propagate through the entire member, is discoverable by the applicable inspection procedures, and will not cause a portion of or the entire bridge to collapse.
The NBIS also defines Nonredundant Steel Tension Member (NSTM) as follows:
NSTM: A primary steel member fully or partially in tension, and without load path redundancy, system redundancy or internal redundancy, whose failure may cause a portion of or the entire bridge to collapse.
312.1 116BLOAD PATH REDUNDANCY
For the strength limit state only, apply a redundancy load modifier (ηR) equal to 1.05 for all elements and components designated as non-redundant. For elements and components designated as redundant, apply a redundancy load modifier (ηR) equal to 1.00 for all limit states.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-246
<em>For superstructure types (a) and (k), as defined in LRFD Table 4.6.2.2.1-1, consider the primary members as nonredundant when the superstructure consists of less than three girder lines.</em>
<em>For superstructure types (a) and (k), as defined in LRFD Table 4.6.2.2.1-1, consider the primary members as nonredundant when the superstructure consists of three longitudinal girder lines spaced greater than 16-ft.</em>
<em>For superstructure types (a) and (k), as defined in LRFD Table 4.6.2.2.1-1, consider the primary members as redundant when the superstructure consists of three longitudinal girder lines spaced at 16-ft or less or four or more longitudinal girder lines regardless of spacing.</em>
312.2 117BFRACTURE CONTROL FOR STEEL MEMBERS
C312.2
All steel members without load path redundancy, as defined in BDM Section 312.1, shall be subjected to fabrication Fracture Control regardless of the member designation. Identify these members in the plans as “FC”.
<em>If a member has been designated as system redundant member (SRM) or an internally redundant member (IRM), fracture control is still required for fabrication. Refer to LRFD 6.6.2.2 for additional information on the designation requirements for the plans.</em>
Until a steel member without load path redundancy, as defined in BDM Section 312.2, has been redesignated to be a system redundant member (SRM) or an internally redundant member (IRM), follow the provisions of BDM Section 312.2 for the load modifier in the design.
The redundancy load modifier (ηR) may be taken as 1.0 for members that have redesignated as SRMs or IRMs.
312.3 118BMEMBER REDESIGNATION
When evaluating an NSTM element for redesignation as either a SRM or IRM, use one of the following guide specifications:
<em>1. AASHTO Guide Specification for Analysis and Identification of Fracture Critical Members and System Redundant Members (GSFCM-1-UL)</em>
<em>2. AASHTO Guide Specification for Internal Redundancy of Mechanically-Fastened Built-Up Members (GSBSM-1-UL)</em>
Do not consider any of the following NSTM elements in a redundancy analysis for SRM or IRM redesignation.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Pins</li>
<li>Hangers</li>
<li>Eyebars
When investigating an existing NSTM element for a redundancy analysis, all the following conditions need to be met to for the NSTM element to be eligible.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-247</li>
<li>Existing structure has undergone a NSTM inspection within the past 24 months.</li>
<li>No plug welds or discontinuous back-up bar splices</li>
<li>No fatigue cracks</li>
<li>No impact damage</li>
<li>No load posting</li>
<li>No element level condition state 4 on the NSTM member
This criterion is only applicable on bridges that receive element level inspections.</li>
<li>The member under consideration does not warrant an NSTM component condition rating of 6 or less.
The objective of this provision is to allow an analysis of an individual NSTM member in good condition when the structure may have an overall NSTM component condition rating of fair or poor.</li>
<li><em>Not susceptible to constraint induced fracture Refer to Publication No. FHWA-HIF-21-046: Evaluation of Steel Bridge Details for Susceptibility to Constraint-Induced Fracture for additional information.</em>
312.3.1 298BSYSTEM REDUNDANCY C312.3.1
<em>Use a nationally recognized method to evaluate a member as a SRM in lieu of NSTM.  If required, conduct a three-dimensional finite element system analysis (FEA) to classify a member as a SRM in lieu of NSTM. The software used to perform the FEA shall meet the minimum requirements in Section 3.1.1 of GSFCM-1-UL.</em>
If a method other than FEA is chosen for the redesignation analysis, this method shall be approved by the Office of Structural Engineering prior to the analysis.
<em>Meet all applicable requirements presented in Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 of GSFCM-1-UL in the FEA.</em>
<em>Guidance on Material Models, Meshing Requirements, Interactions, Constraints, Application of Loads, and Boundary Conditions are given in Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 of GSFCM-1-UL.</em>
<em>Consider all applicable failure scenarios outlined in Section 3.1.3 of GSFCM-1-UL in the FEA.</em>
312.3.1.1 481BLOADS &amp; LOAD COMBINATIONS
Use the provisions of GSFCM-1-UL to investigate two distinct redundancy load combinations. For each redundancy load combination, apply the total load, Qu, calculated using the following equation:
Qu = (1 + DAR)[γDCDC + γDWDW + γLL(LL + IM)]
Where:
γ = Load factor DC = Dead load of structural components and
nonstructural attachments
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-248
DW = Dead load of wearing surfaces and utilities LL = Vehicular live load
DAR = Dynamic amplification factor IM = Vehicular dynamic allowance
If bridge members were fabricated using the AASHTO/AWS D1.5 FCP use the load factors presented in BDM Table 312-1.
Table 312-1: Bridge Members Fabricated using AASHTO/AWS D1.5 FCP
Load Combination γDC γDC γDC DA- IM
Redundancy I 1.05 1.05 0.85 0.40 0.00 Redundancy II 1.05 1.05 1.30 0.00 0.15
If bridge members were not fabricated using the AASHTO/AWS D1.5 FCP use the load factors presented in BDM Table 312-2.
Table 312-2: Bridge Members Not Fabricated using AASHTO/AWS D1.5 FCP
Load Combination γDC γDC γDC DAR IM
Redundancy I 1.15 1.25 1.00 0.40 0.00 Redundancy II 1.15 1.25 1.50 0.00 0.15
Dead loads for proposed structures shall consist of all gravity loads, including future loads. Apply dead loads as body forces.
For existing structures, apply only the dead loads present on the structure at the time of analysis. A new analysis will be required when the loading on the bridge changes. Refer to BDM Section 914 for a list of loading changes that warrants a new analysis.
<em>Live Loads shall consist of the HL-93 vehicular live load as defined in LRFD Section 3.6.1.2.  Apply the live loads in each load combination as described below.</em>
Redundancy I: This is the load combination relating to a point-in-time live load applied at the instant when the assumed failure of the member occurs. The intent of this loading scenario is to capture the effects of dynamic amplification immediately following the member failure.</li>
<li>The number of lanes is the number of striped travel lanes only. Center the live load at the center of the striped lanes.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-249
Redundancy II: This is the load combination relating to normal vehicular use of the bridge without wind after the failure of a primary member. The intent of this load combination is to capture the loading after the fracture has occurred and the structure has reached a steady state.</li>
<li>Use LRFD Section 3.6.1.1.1 to determine the number of lanes. Position the lanes transversely to produce the largest demand on the remaining unfractured components.
312.3.2 299BITERNAL REDUNDANCY C312.3.2
The GSBSM-1-UL groups similar types of built-up members into flexural, two-component axial, and multi-component axial.  Flexural members are bolted girders or beams with at least one tension cover plate.  Two-component axial members are composed of only two steel sections bolted together so if one section fails, the other will take the full load.  Multi-component axial members are composed of 3 or more steel sections bolted together and providing multiple load paths if one section fails.
Evaluate members at the worst-case stress locations for each individual cross section configuration in the faulted state for strength in accordance with the guide specifications. Any location or cross section of a member failing the strength check in the faulted state is not eligible to be classified as internally redundant.
For members passing the strength checks in the faulted state, evaluate fatigue for both unfaulted and faulted states to gain an understanding of the potential life of the member before a fatigue crack may form.
Calculate inspection intervals based on the fatigue life in accordance with the Guide Specifications based on the analysis results.
Inspection intervals are likely to differ along the bridge at each cross section analyzed.  For each structure, the owner will determine if the critical locations will all be inspected at the lowest inspection interval allowed or if inspection intervals at each location will be based on what is allowed per the analysis.
Fatigue may be evaluated using field measured effective stress ranges at the desired cross sections in the structure to potentially obtain more favorable fatigue life calculations.
312.3.3 300BPERFORMANCE IN THE FAULTED STATE
To determine if an existing or new steel tension member without load path redundancy can be designated as a SRM or an IRM in lieu of NSTM can be redesignated as SRM or IRM in lieu of NSTM, the member shall meet performance criteria developed to establish the minimum acceptable performance level in the faulted state.
BDM Section 300 – Detail Design 2020 Edition – January 2025
3-250
<em>These elements shall meet all applicable Strength, Service, and Extreme Event requirements detailed in AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specification and this manual.</em>
<em>For designation as SRM, meet the Performance Criteria detailed in Section 8 of GSFCM-1-UL, except as noted in this manual.</em>
Section 8.2.1 of the GSFCM-1-UL requires an analysis with the live load at a 15% increase, this shall apply only to existing members being investigated for redesignated. Proposed members being designated as SRM shall be designed to remain linearly elastic at all load combinations.
<em>For designation of existing members as IRM, designs shall meet the Performance Criteria detailed in Section 2 of GSBSM-1-UL. Proposed members being designated as IRM shall be designed to remain linearly elastic at all load combinations.</em>
312.3.4 301BSUBMITAL REQUIREMENTS

<li>Criteria to define when the member would default back to an NSTM.</li>
<li>A comprehensive Calculation Package shall be included in the Final Calculation Submittal.
312.3.4.1 482BSPECIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THREE-GIRDER STRADDLE BENTS
Stacked Three-Grider Straddle bents are load path redundant.
Stacked Three-Grider Straddle Bents, where the longitudinal girders are “stacked” on top of the Straddle Bent, and a bearing is provided under each I-girder web comprising the straddle, have been nationally recognized as having load path redundancy and no system redundancy analysis is required.
The analysis may consider all bracing, continuous framed girders, deck (and all reinforcement), and continuous concrete barriers as being effective for load transfer.
Integral straddle bents, where the longitudinal girders frame into the side of the straddle bent, will need to be analyzed for system redundancy regardless of the number of bearings that are used under the beam.
Consider fractures at points of maximum load effects at the Strength I load combination in the analysis. If only one bearing is used under the straddle bent, show that the load transfer to the single bearing can be maintained by adding more fracture analysis cases to diaphragms or other critical members as may be necessary.
These high stress values may occur for symmetrically loaded simple supported members at midspan and near the support of one of the exterior girders of the three-girder system.
When the three-girder straddle bent is subjected to the dead load portion of the Redundancy II load combination in the faulted state, the primary steel members with any tension shall be designated as NSTMs if the straddle cap experiences a maximum vertical deflection larger than L/50.

SECTION 400 – REHABILITATION AND MAINTENANCE
401 20BINTRODUCTION
BDM Sections 100, 200 &amp; 300 apply for the design of Rehabilitation and Maintenance to existing bridges except as noted in BDM Section 100.
Refer to BDM Section 101 for a description of the format, audience, purpose and more related to this Manual.
401.1 119BGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS C401.1
Perform a site visit to the structure and identify/verify defects that may exist, in order to tailor solutions to all problems found. During this site visit, take color photographs and develop sketches showing pertinent details and field verified dimensions. Schedule this visit during the plan development phase of the project.
For individual members, determine whether the best option is to repair or replace. In making this decision, consider cost along with factors such as traffic maintenance, convenience to the public, longevity of the structure, whether the rehab is long term or short term, and the practicality of all options.
Verify all pertinent field dimensions. Do not to take dimensions directly from old plans without checking them in the field because deviations from plans are common. The Designer is responsible for providing accurate bid information based on field observations and preparing plans that reflect the actual field conditions. Under C&amp;MS 105.02, the Contractor is responsible for taking measurements of existing structures to accurately join new and existing work. Include the plan note provided in BDM Section 603 entitled “EXISTING STRUCTURE VERIFICATION” to clarify the Department’s contractual approach to uncertainties.
401.2 120BDESIGN SPECIFICATIONS
<em>Design rehabilitations to existing structures in accordance with the latest edition of the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications and this Manual.</em>
401.3 121BDESIGN LOADING C401.3
<em>The Design Loading for the rehabilitation of vehicular bridges shall be in accordance with the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications, Section 3. The Design Loading for bridges carrying high speed (i.e. Design Speed &gt; 45 mph) National Highway System traffic shall include a dead load allowance for future wearing surfaces equal to 0.06-ksf applied to the deck surface for the full length of the bridge from face-to-face of curbs and/or railing. No allowance for future wearing surfaces is required for all other bridges.</em>
Include the Vehicular Live Load and Future Wearing Surface allowance in the Proposed Structure Block on the Site Plan as specified in BDM Section 201.1.2.2.G.
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025
4-2
401.4 122BDESIGN EXCEPTIONS C401.4
Bridge rehabilitation and maintenance projects that do not require a revised load rating according to BDM Section 914 will not require a Design Exception for Design Loading Structural Capacity.
Evaluate bridges that do require a revised load rating according to BDM Section 914 for a Design Exception for Design Load Structural Capacity as follows:
A. For a bridge that will receive a new overlay according to BDM Section 403.4.1 with a resulting Operating level rating factor less than 1.08 for all Ohio Legal Loads defined in BDM Section 908.3, a Design Exception is required.
The purpose for this provision is to identify bridges receiving a new rigid overlay that will require Bridge Posting for Reduced Load Limits in accordance with BDM Section 919. An Owner needs an approved Design Exception in order to fund a bridge rehabilitation project that leaves the structure capacity below Ohio Legal Load limits. Refer to BDM Section 919.3.1.H for information on which LFR or LRFR rating method applies.
B. When the Scope of Services requires rehabilitation of a superstructure resulting in an Inventory level rating factor less than 1.00 for HL-93 loading, a Design Exception is required. To determine the governing inventory level rating factor, load rate the superstructure in accordance with BDM Section 900.
<em>C. When the Scope of Services requires substructure and foundation analysis for a rehabilitation resulting in any member of the bridge substructure or foundation with a capacity-to-demand ratio less than 1.00 for the Design Loading defined in BDM Section 401.3, a Design Exception is required. To determine the governing capacity-to-demand ratio analyze the substructure members specified in the Scope of Services in accordance with the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications. The capacity-to-demand ratio for each member analyzed shall be determined by rewriting LRFD Eq. 1.3.2.1-1 as follows: 𝐶𝐶 𝐷𝐷</em>
= ϕ𝑅𝑅𝑛𝑛
∑η𝑖𝑖𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖𝑄𝑄𝑖𝑖
This requirement is not intended to dictate the level of analysis required for every existing structure. It simply sets the minimum structural capacity for an existing structure or portions of an existing structure that are to be analyzed. The Scope of Services should define the portions of the structure to be analyzed.
With regard to establishing what portions of a structure to analyze, it is not economically feasible to require an analysis for the entirety of every existing bridge in need of rehabilitation. The importance of the route carried by the bridge and the existing condition of the bridge are factors to be considered. Routes of high importance may consist of interstates, major routes, or high traffic roadways connecting urban areas.
In general, the load capacity of existing substructure and foundation elements may be assumed to be adequate for reuse without a detailed structural analysis when:
A. The substructure elements are in good condition (NBIS Condition Rating of 6 or greater) and show no significant structural distress under existing live load, AND
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025
4-3
B. The proposed service dead load is not greater than 115% of the original designed service dead load at the top of the substructure element (top of bearing seat), AND
C. There is no significant reconfiguration of load configuration (i.e. changes to bearing locations or substructure fixities).
Additional guidance can be found in BDM Section 912 and BDM Section 309.3.8.2.a.
It may not be feasible to increase the capacity of an existing member to the Design Loading for every structure. Designers should investigate the cost and feasibility to increase capacity to alternative service levels during preliminary engineering and consider requesting a Design Exception.
In addition to the documentation required by L&amp;D, Vol. 1, include a copy of the Load Rating Report with the Design Exception request for Design Loading Structural Capacity. Include rating factors for all rating vehicles defined in BDM Section 908.
Rating vehicles include: Ohio Legal Commercial Vehicles (2F1, 3F1, 4F1 &amp; 5C1); Special Hauling Vehicles (SU4, SU5, SU6 &amp; SU7); and Emergency Vehicles (EV2 &amp; EV3).
Provide a statement in the Design Loading General Note when an approved Design Exception for Design Loading Structural Capacity has been approved.
401.5 123BPLAN PREPARATION
401.5.1 302BGENERAL PLAN
In addition to the requirements listed in BDM Section 103, provide a General Plan sheet for:
A. Deck overlay projects
B. Deck replacement projects where the bridge deck is variable width or curved
C. Rehabilitated bridges requiring staged construction.
401.5.2 303BNARRATIVE OF BRIDGE ALTERNATIVES
In addition to the Narrative of Bridge Alternatives requirements listed in BDM Section 201.1.2.3, include color photographs of the portions of the existing structure to be salvaged. To substantiate the proposed salvage decision, identify all areas of rehabilitation by field investigation.
For steel superstructures, include the findings of the Fatigue Evaluation defined in BDM Section 0.
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025
4-4
401.5.3 304BCOST ANALYSIS C401.5.3
When a rehabilitation alternate involves salvaging existing concrete members, cost overruns should be anticipated and included in the cost analysis.
401.5.4 305BFINAL STRUCTURE SITE PLAN C401.5.4
In addition to the requirements listed in BDM Section 201.2.1.1, the first item in the “Proposed Structure” data block shall be “Proposed Work” followed by a brief description of the type of work to be done.
Examples description of “Proposed Work”: new composite reinforced concrete deck, new superstructure on existing substructure, or new superstructure on widened substructure
Provide a relatively thorough description (list of work) of the type of work to be done within a plan note entitled “Proposed Work” and include this note on the Final Site Plan.
402 21BCLEANING BRIDGES C402
When specified in the Scope of Services, clean bridges as follows. Clean the three areas of the bridge listed below:
A. Expansion Joints
B. Scuppers and Drainage Troughs C. Bridge Seats under expansion joints
Perform Bridge Cleaning in accordance to the Bridge Cleaning plan insert sheets located on the Office of Structural Engineering website.
These cleaning provisions apply to bridges which have routine maintenance responsibility provided by ODOT.
Benefit for Cleaning of bridges:
Cleaning Deck Joints – Cleaning deck joints helps the joint perform as intended. Debris that sits on top of an elastomeric seal is packed down by traffic. A sharp object will exert a great deal of pressure as traffic travels over the packed down debris. This damages the elastomeric seals and they will leak and allow debris to fall onto the bridge seat below. Cleaning the deck joints will help keep the joints functioning as designed.
Clearing Debris from Scuppers/Drainage Troughs – Controlling deck drainage is important to maintaining a bridge in good condition. When chloride laden deck drainage does not follow the path that was originally intended, deterioration of bridge components may begin and accelerate. Components of the bridge that remain damp with high chloride content are prime locations for deterioration. Clearing debris from scuppers and drainage troughs will not pond chloride laden drainage on the bridge deck and will increase the life of the bridge deck.
Cleaning Bridge Seats – Debris built up on bridge seats holds moisture against the bearings and seats. The moisture laden debris will cause the steel sections of bearings to rust and deteriorate and cause spalling of the concrete seat. The debris generally deposits on the bridge seat through an open expansion deck joint or a defective deck expansion joint. Keeping the bridge seats free of debris will extend the life of the bridge

403 22BDECK C403
Preparing the existing concrete for any sealing, patching, or overlay is very important for a durable repair. There are many products used in these processes all require a degree of removing deteriorated and damaged concrete, leaving a sound surface for the repair material to bond. BDM Table 403-1 provides a guide for concrete removal types and application to be considered.

403.1 124BDECK CONDITION SURVEY C403.1
For each deck rehabilitation considered on a project, provide a Deck Condition Survey that includes the information listed below. Prepare the survey as near as practicable to the plan preparation stage and before beginning detail design work for deck rehabilitations.
The Deck Condition Survey provides justification for the deck rehabilitation treatment selected.
Do not perform any deck evaluation technique unless specified in the Scope of Services.
There are numerous concrete deck evaluation techniques available to help determine the appropriate treatment option for a deck in need of rehabilitation.
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025
4-6
Many of the commonly used techniques are further described in BDM Sections 403.1.1 through 403.1.8. This Manual does not present an exhaustive list of concrete testing methods; however, a combination of the techniques identified herein will provide a sound basis for identifying an appropriate treatment method. Refer to the project Scope of Services to determine which techniques to apply.
A. All bridge inventory information B. Most recent bridge inspection findings
C. Age and history of existing and previous wearing course(s) including original deck thickness and concrete reinforcement cover (where available)
Provide as much information on the history of the deck that is available including amount of surface removal for previous overlays.
D. Dates and results of all evaluation techniques performed on the bridge deck
Refer to the Scope of Services for which techniques to employ on a project
E. Sketches of the top and bottom surface of the deck dimensioning: locations of unsound areas; delamination; cracking/crack density; spalling; patching; discoloration, efflorescence and moisture staining; traffic lane locations; and all testing/sampling locations
Be as accurate as possible locating all signs of deterioration. This information shall be the basis for estimating the amount of unsound deck area.
F. Photos of the top and bottom surface of the deck
G. Photos and description of all cores and core holes (if applicable)
H. Estimate of the percentage of total deck surface area deemed unsound
I. Distribution of the unsound area per travel lanes
J. Recommendations for deck rehabilitation treatment (e.g. sealing, patching, overlay, replacement) and estimated service life
The Deck Condition Survey may provide multiple recommendations for treatments. Each recommended treatment method shall include an independent cost estimate, MOT considerations and estimated service life.
K. Cost estimate for rehabilitation
L. Maintenance of traffic considerations for rehabilitation
403.1.1 306BHAMMER SOUND &amp; CHAIN DRAG C403.1.1
When specified in the Scope of Services, perform chain drag sounding on the deck surface in accordance with ASTM D4580. Sound the deck underside where there are indications of delamination, water intrusion, discoloration, spalls, efflorescence or other signs of distress and visually mark areas on and under the deck.
The Hammer Sound and Chain Drag technique is the most well-established field collection method and requires little training. This method is labor intensive, requires traffic control, and should be scheduled when traffic noise is minimal.
Survey a minimum 40% of the traveled lanes. The survey area should focus upon traffic lanes with visual damage or having the most truck traffic.
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025
4-7
403.1.2 307BCORING C403.1.2
When specified in the Scope of Services perform deck coring as follows.
Core concrete decks according to ASTM C42. Determine the number of cores to be taken using the following criteria:
Coring is a destructive technique that provides samples for strength, permeability and chloride concentration testing for determining extent of deterioration. More importantly, this technique also provides visual evidence of the integrity of the deck.
A. A minimum of two (2) per bridge for bridges with a deck area less than 2500-ft2
B. A minimum of three (3) per bridge for bridges with a deck area between 2500-ft2 to 5000-ft2
C. A minimum of four (4) per bridge for bridges with a deck area between 5000-ft2 to 10,000-ft2 with one additional core for each additional 10,000-ft2 or part thereof up to a maximum of 6 total.
For bridge decks with an asphalt overlay, additional cores may be necessary due to the variability of unknowns hidden under the overlay.
Due to the inability to evaluate the floor condition of bridges with stay-in-place forms, the number of minimum cores listed should be increased by one.
Take at least one core from an apparently sound area to compare with core(s) taken from questionable areas. Take cores in questionable areas to verify and further define areas of unsoundness. If it is suspected that full depth repair may be required, take full depth cores or at least core to the bottom mat of concrete reinforcement in those areas.
The underside of the deck needs to be considered when determining core locations.
Questionable areas are areas that exhibit signs of greater deterioration compared with concrete to be removed with the uniform concrete removal depth. Questionable areas are illustrated by advanced cracking, leaking through the deck, buildup of efflorescence, widespread rust staining, or discoloration of the underside of concrete deck.
Inspect the cores and core holes for: crumbling; stratification or delamination zones; soundness of aggregate; and depth and condition of concrete reinforcement. If required by the Scope of Services, test core samples for bond strength according to BDM Section 403.1.9; for compressive strength according to ASTM C39; for permeability according to ASTM C1202 and for chloride concentration according to BDM Section 403.1.6.
Cores to determine compressive strength containing embedded reinforcing can yield erroneous results. Embedded steel should be avoided if possible when compressive strengths are required, concrete cores can be tested if trimmed to eliminate the reinforcement provided core length-to-diameter (L/D) of 1.00 or greater can be attained.
Plot the location of all cores on a plan view of the deck and provide a description of the cores and all test results with the Deck Condition Survey report.
Unless otherwise specified in the Scope of Services, the depth of concrete cores shall be taken to the bottom of the lower mat of reinforcement.
Core depth should be full depth for decks with stay-in-place forms.
Core depths used to verify existing overlay depth or reinforcing depth need not be deeper than the first mat of concrete reinforcement.
Submit the cores to the District Bridge Engineer or owner with proper identification.
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025
4-8
Repair core holes using an ODOT approved non-shrink mortar, C&amp;MS 705.22, installed according to the manufacturer’s recommended specifications. Seal repair with HMWM according to C&amp;MS 512.04
403.1.3 308BGROUND PENETRATING RADAR (GPR)
C403.1.3
When specified in the Scope of Services, perform GPR testing in accordance with ASTM D6087. Operators shall be certified by the manufacturer to operate the equipment and process the data. Additionally, operators shall possess 24 months of documented GPR testing and analysis experience.
Ground penetrating radar can be used to determine depth to reinforcement, deck thickness, overlay thickness, reinforcement position, and defects in the upper half of the deck. Because the GPR unit can travel as fast as 55 mph while collecting data, there&#39;s no need for traffic interruption. The test is nondestructive, so there&#39;s no follow-up repair work. Unlike other methods, GPR works on bridge decks covered with asphalt overlays. The results are typically reliable and repeatable. This technique does require advanced expertise and training for data collection, processing and interpretation. This makes this technique more cost effective as the deck area increases. Coring in accordance with BDM Section 403.1.2 may be used to supplement GPR results
403.1.4 309BINFRARED (IR) THERMOGRAPHY C403.1.4
When specified in the Scope of Services, perform Infrared Thermography in accordance with ASTM D4788.
Infrared Thermography will detect concrete defects by measuring temperature variations on the surface of an element resulting from differences in thermal conductivity within the element. Defective areas of concrete will heat up faster after sunrise and cool down more quickly after sunset when compared to sound concrete. The best time for an IR survey is between 5 and 9 hours after sunrise or sunset; however, cloudiness and precipitation will reduce effectiveness. Accuracy of results is highly dependent upon collecting data during appropriate environmental conditions. When using vehicle mounted systems, this technique is more cost effective and can be less disruptive to traffic control when compared to coring, and half-cell testing. However, this technique will not provide information about the depth of defect. Coring in accordance with BDM Section 403.1.2 may be used to supplement IR results.
403.1.5 310BIMPACT ECHO C403.1.5
When specified in the Scope of Services, perform a stress wave-based impact echo survey method conforming to ASTM C1383-98a. Provide color contour map of data analysis indicating thickness of deck, location of delaminations, debonding overlays, or voids in post-tension ducts.
Impact Echo provides benefits over traditional chain dragging of bare concrete decks. The method can detect and assess delamination at various deterioration stages and can detect deeper delamination, evaluate vertical cracks, detect and characterize conditions around rebars and tendon ducts, and can be used as a material evaluation tool.
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025
4-9
Conduct impact echo test in all traveled lanes. The impact echo data collection for delamination detection purpose is relatively slow and requires lane closure.
403.1.6 311BCHLORIDE CONCENTRATION TESTING
C403.1.6
When specified in the Scope of Services, perform chloride concentration testing as follows.
Analyze the chloride ion content of all cores according to ASTM C1218. For projects with no coring requirements specified, drill 1-in diameter holes in the deck to a maximum depth of 2-in, or as specified in the Scope of Services, with a rotary impact drill. Collect powdered concrete samples at every 0.5-in of hole depth. After collecting each sample and before proceeding further, thoroughly clean hole with compressed air to avoid contaminating future sample collection. Label all sample containers by location and sample depth. Analyze the chloride ion content of all collected samples according to ASTM C1218. Repair all holes according to BDM Section 403.1.2. Determine the number of drill holes using the coring requirements of BDM Section 403.1.2.
Prepare a report of all test results. Include a plan view of the deck that identifies all hole locations and chloride ion concentrations.
The purpose of chloride concentration testing is to determine the extent of chloride ingress into the concrete surface. Corrosion of uncoated mild steel reinforcement due to chloride ingress is a primary cause of damage to reinforced concrete structures.
Unlike the case for uncoated mild steel reinforcement, no published literature presents definitive chloride threshold for epoxy-coated mild steel reinforcement. Generally, decks with epoxy-coated steel reinforcement with the original monolithic overlay do not require chloride concentration testing.
It is recommended all decks being considered for a 2nd generation concrete overlay (or greater) receive chloride concentration testing.
For reference; uncoated mild steel reinforcement, corrosion typically exists when the chloride ion content exceeds 2-lb/yd3.
For epoxy-coated mild steel reinforcement, corrosion is suggested to exist when the chloride ion content exceeds 3.5 to 4.0-lb/yd3. The threshold is based upon uncertainties associated with: the quality of the organic coating of the epoxy; damage that could have occurred during transportation or storage of the epoxy-coated reinforcement; loss of adhesion between the coating and the base metal; or damage caused during the original overlay replacement.
Repair core holes using an ODOT approved non-shrink, non-metallic material per C&amp;MS 705.20, installed according to the manufacturer’s recommended specifications.
403.1.7 312BHALF-CELL POTENTIAL C403.1.7
When specified in the Scope of Services, perform Half-Cell potential testing according to ASTM C876. Assume active corrosion is occurring if an observed rebar electrical potential reading is more negative than -0.35-volts measured by copper-copper sulfate reference half-cell. The maximum spacing between test locations shall be 2-ft measured longitudinally and transversely across the entire deck area.
Half-Cell potential surveys are useful for monitoring the effectiveness of concrete overlay protective systems as the bridge deck ages. This is accomplished by comparing Half-Cell potential readings at the same locations once per year using the same ground. Utilizing a Half-Cell survey to designate specific repair areas is not recommended.
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025
4-10
In addition to the reporting requirements of ASTM C876, include in the survey report: the date of survey; general weather conditions; a plan view of the deck area showing all Half-Cell test locations; ground location; voltage measurements; and an equipotential contour map.
Table 403-2
Half-Cell Potential Corrosion Activity
Less negative than -0.20-V
90% probability of no corrosion
Between -0.20 and -0.35-V
Uncertain corrosion activity
More negative than -0.35-V
90% probability of corrosion
Because coated reinforcement does not provide a good electrical connection for the measuring circuit throughout the deck limits, the ASTM C876 standard indicates that the half-cell potential technique is not suitable for measurements involving epoxy-coated and galvanized steel reinforcement. However, there is evidence measurements can be obtained because of coating defects or damage and unprotected rebar ends. Consideration of half-cell testing should only be considered on 2nd generation or later overlays.
403.1.8 313BELECTRICAL RESISTIVITY (ER) C403.1.8
When specified in the Scope of Services, perform Electrical Resistivity testing in accordance with ASTM D3633.
Electrical Resistivity will detect areas susceptible to corrosion due to moisture and chloride penetration. Delaminated and cracked areas, due to increased porosity, will form preferential paths for fluid and ion flow. This will lead to higher moisture and chloride concentrations and higher concrete electrical conductivity, manifesting as a lower electrical resistivity. Electrical resistivity is typically measured in units of kΩ-cm using a device called the Wenner probe. Readings less than 5-kΩ-cm indicate a very high corrosion rate and readings greater than 20-kΩ-cm indicate a low corrosion rate.
This technique requires traffic control and data collection may be time consuming. This makes this technique less cost effective as the deck area increases. However, it can be very effective for determining the severity of localized areas of corrosion.
403.1.9 314B OND STRENGTH TESTING C403.1.9
When specified in the Scope of Services, perform bond testing by one of the following methods
Bond strength testing of the existing overlays may be required when the complete removal of the existing overlay cannot be performed due to depth of removal located at or below the top mat of steel reinforcing.
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025
4-11
While typically used as QC/QA method for new construction, bond strength of concrete overlays is critical to the performance and capital importance when decicing if any apportion, there are several procedures to measure the bond strength of a concrete overlay.
On site testing BOND-TEST; conduct a pull-off test in accordance with ASTM C1583, &#34;Test Method for Tensile Strength of Concrete Surfaces and the Bond Strength or Tensile Strength of Concrete Repair and Overlay Materials by Direct Tension (Pull-off-Method).&#34;
A pulloff test measurers the tensile bond. It is similar to the ACI method for determining the adhesion of epoxies to concrete substrates (ACI 503R, Ref 88). A field test, in which, a core is drilled but not extracted. The drilling is stopped slightly below the depth of the overlay and the test apparatus is attached. Overlays with test specimen having tensile failures inside the original deck concrete are acceptable to remain in place
For cores taken perform a Slant Shear Method, ASTM C 1042.
The Slant Shear Method is a laboratory test, based on ASTM C 1042, and is the most common method for determining bond strengths of epoxies and latex systems used with concrete. Developed to measure the effectiveness of latex in bonding fresh concrete to hardened concrete. Generally, a bond strength greater than 75% of the original deck concrete is acceptable to remain in place.
403.2 125BPATCHING
403.2.1 315BSURFACE C403.2.1
Repair spalls in the monolithic concrete deck wearing surface in accordance with C&amp;MS 256 using a Type B or C patch material.
A patching repair is appropriate for bridge decks with spalls in the monolithic concrete deck wearing surface comprising less than 10% of the total deck area.
These patch materials typically require 4-6-hour lane closures.
Repair localized unsound areas within an existing rigid overlay in accordance either PN511, C&amp;MS 256, C&amp;MS 519, or SS844.
A patching repair is appropriate for localized unsound areas within an existing rigid overlay comprising less than 15% of the total deck area.
When patching decks containing uncoated reinforcement, the addition of embedded galvanic anodes per SS844 will help protect the existing concrete surrounding patched area.
403.2.2 316BUNDER DECK C403.2.2
For an under-deck spall with exposed uncoated reinforcement, remove all loose concrete, mechanically clean concrete reinforcement and coat with paints containing zinc dust. Provide galvanizing material conforming to ASTM A780 except aerosol spray applications will not be permitted.
Spalls located in haunches and spalls exposing coated reinforcement typically do not require repairs
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025
4-12
When specified in the Scope of Services to patch an under-deck spall located over vehicular, rail or pedestrian traffic, seal the patch material with and FRP wrap/cover in accordance with PN519 - Composite Fiber Wrap System. The patch material shall be in accordance with C&amp;MS 519 when the deck reinforcement is coated or with SS844 when the deck reinforcement is uncoated.
In almost all cases the best option for preventing damaged concrete from falling onto traffic is to confine the patch material with Fiber Reinforced Polymer wraps. The type of wrap will be selected by contractor.
403.3 126BSEALING C403.3
Seal all major bridges and mainline priority system bridges with a concrete wearing surface as follows:
A. For decks that are cracked, seal the deck using HMWM or Gravity-Fed Resin according to C&amp;MS 512.06 every 10 years.
B. For decks that are not cracked or only minor hairline cracks, seal the deck using SRS (Soluble Reactive Silicate) according to C&amp;MS 512.05 every 5 years.
Sealing bridge decks will extend their service life. ODOT’s major bridges are some of the highest value assets that the Department maintains. A couple of ODOT’s major bridges have decks that will be extremely difficult and costly to replace (segmental and cable stayed structures). Maintaining these decks in good condition is critical. Replacing the deck on a mainline priority system bridge can be very disruptive to traffic. Maintaining these decks in good condition is important to minimize disruption to traffic. In general, bridge decks should be sealed when they are in good to fair condition. Bridge decks in poor condition should be programed for rehabilitation.
403.3.1 317BGRAVITY-FED RESIN C403.3.1
Seal deck surface with Gravity-fed Resin in accordance with C&amp;MS 512.06.
Gravity-fed resins are very low viscosity (250 cps, similar to SAE 30 motor oil or maple syrup) epoxy crack fillers. These products are cost effective when used to flood deck surfaces with widespread deck cracking. Sand is broadcast over the sealed surfaces to increase slip resistance. C&amp;MS 512.06 specifies a minimum 6-hr cure period after placement before surfaces receive traffic. The six-hour cure period could be expected with temperatures around 70 degrees and sunshine to help with the curing process.  The sealers will take about two hours additional cure time with every 10 degrees drop in temperature and nighttime application will also slow the curing process further.  Please review the QPL on the OMM website for additional information if you have a short duration closure. These sealers need a 36-hr window of dry weather with temperatures between 40°F and 100°F.
403.3.2 318BSOLUBLE REACTIVE SILICATE (SRS)
C403.3.2
Treat deck surface with Soluble Reactive Silicate in accordance with C&amp;MS 512.05.
SRS is a concrete treatment that penetrates the pores in the concrete surface, reacts with the concrete, and creates a by-product that fills the porosity. SRS is not intended as a crack filler. SRS can be used on bridge decks that experience early-age cracks with widths of 0.001-in to 0.08-in. Sealers should be applied before the onset of severe damage to be effective.
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025
4-13
Reapply SRS periodically to maintain long-term effectiveness. Studies indicate that SRS may provide 5-7 years of reduced permeability and corrosion protection for the deck surface.
403.3.3 319BHIGH MOLECULAR WEIGHT METHACRYLATE (HMWM)
C403.3.3
Seal deck surface with High Molecular Weight Methacrylate in accordance with C&amp;MS 512.04.
HMWM sealers are extremely low viscosity (25 cps, similar to antifreeze) multi-component crack sealer/fillers. These products are most cost effective when drizzled into isolated deck cracks and cold joints as specified in C&amp;MS 511.19. These products may also be used to flood deck surfaces but are less cost effective as the deck area increases. C&amp;MS 512.04 specifies a minimum 6-hr cure period after placement before surfaces receive traffic. The six-hour cure period could be expected with temperatures around 70 degrees and sunshine to help with the curing process.  The sealers will take about two hours additional cure time with every 10 degrees drop in temperature and nighttime application also slow the curing process further.  Please review the QPL on the OMM website for additional information if you have a short duration closure. These sealers need a 36-hr window of dry weather with temperatures between 50°F and 85°F.
HMWM is typically limited to maximum crack widths of 10 mils or less and has an effective life of 5-7 years.
HMWM can be aesthetically displeasing (green tint) and is not intended to be a wearing surface replacement.
HMWM can be used on new decks that have extensive cracks.
403.4 127BOVERLAY C403.4
The amount of uniform depth removed from the existing concrete deck surface shall not expose the top mat of reinforcement.
Theoretically, there is no limit to the number of overlays a bridge deck may have during its life cycle provided the uniform depth limit is not exceeded. The depth of removal specified for an overlay shall be based upon existing overlay condition, underlying deck condition and material data collected specified in BDM Section 403.1.
The service life of a first-generation overlay may extend the life of a bridge, when applied to a deck in a condition state of 5 or 6. Subsequent overlays may not have the service life extension as the previous.
Concrete overlays are used to establish a new wearing surface, restore ride quality, and protect the underlying deck. Typically, overlays are the preferred option for bridge preservation. See BDM Table 403-4 when selecting an overlay treatment
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025
4-14
Do not specify overlays for the sole purpose of adjusting the profile grade.
Do not specify an overlay on new decks. Waiver of this requirement should only be considered for bridges that have decks that are not replaceable (e.g. cable stayed bridge decks, Post-tensioned box girder superstructures, and superstructure members with integral wearing surfaces).
Specify RPM’s in accordance with the TEM. For optimal performance of the overlay, RPM’s should be placed at the minimum requirements.
403.4.1 320BRIGID CONCRETE C403.4.1
Provide a rigid concrete overlay removal in accordance with either SS847 – Bridge Deck Repair and Overlay With Concrete Using Scarification And Chipping or SS848 – Bridge Deck Repair And Overlay With Concrete Using Hydro-Demolition. Available overlay material includes:
SS847 and SS848 provide different methods of surface preparation for the installation of the rigid concrete overlay. SS847 requires mechanical scarification of the existing concrete surface. SS848 requires mechanical scarification with hydro-demolition of the existing concrete surface.
A. Micro-Silica Modified B. Latex Modified
C. Superplasticized Dense D. Polyester Polymer Concrete (PPC)
SS847 is the most appropriate overlay application for the following bridge decks:
A. Replacing a well-bonded overlay on an existing deck
B. Placing an overlay on an existing deck with a uniform depth of distress
C. Replacing an existing debonded overlay with a limited amounts of hand chipping (variable depth removal)
SS848 is the most appropriate overlay for situations with higher amounts of deterioration. SS848 requires less labor to remove unsound concrete beneath the uniform removal thickness because the variable depth material removed by high pressure water in SS848 is removed by chipping hammers in SS847. SS847 becomes less cost effective as the variable depth area increases. However, on bridges with very little to no unsound area, SS847 is more cost effective as the cost to collect the hydro-demolition run-off water is eliminated.
Hydro-demolition (SS848) is more appropriate on 2nd generation and 3rd generation overlays as these tend to involve a higher quantity of variable depth removal.
One way to reduce costs associated with collection and disposal of hydro-demolition waste water is to identify a location for the disposal that is compliant with the Ohio EPA General Wastewater Disposal System Permit to Install (PTI) for Land Application of Hydro-Demolition Wastewater. More information is available in the Designer Note for SS848.
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025
4-15
The following table provides an estimate for the variable thickness quantity for plan development based on the measured area of unsound deck defined in the Deck Condition Survey (BDM Section 403.1). The plan estimate should be increased by a factor of 1.10 when the deck survey data is one winter old.
The Variable Thickness values in the table are for a 1st generation overlay. The factors should be increased by 1.15 for 2nd generation and greater overlays.
Table 403-3
Measured Unsound Area (% Total Deck
Area)
Estimating Factor
Variable Thickness
(% Total Deck Area)
0-10 3.00 0-30 15 2.33 35 20 2.00 40 25 1.90 47.5 30 1.87 55 35 1.79 62.5 40 1.69 67.5 45 1.56 70 50 1.50 75 60 1.33 80 70 1.21 85 80 1.09 87.5 90 1.00 90
Benefits derived from a deck replacement when compared to an overlay are approximately equal when the amount of unsound deck area is in the range of 60% to 80% of the total deck area. Therefore, unless overriding circumstances exist, replacement of the existing decks should be considered rather than a deck overlay when the unsound area exceeds 70% of the total deck area.
Do not specify a uniform removal depth “D” that will expose the top mat of deck reinforcement. Provide a plan note to specify “D” differing from the default values specified in the applicable overlay specification.
To maintain structural integrity, avoid rehabilitation methods that expose large areas of the top mat reinforcement where tension exists (e.g. cantilevered deck edges and negative moment regions over piers). This is especially critical for slab superstructures.
SS847 and SS848 define a uniform removal depth “D” as the distance from the bottom of the uniform removal to the top of an existing deck without an overlay or to the top of an existing deck after the removal of an existing overlay.
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025
4-16
For SS847, the default value for “D” is 0.25-in.
For SS848, the default value for “D” is 1.0-in.
For decks with an existing overlay, determine the thickness of the existing overlay from core samples, if available, rather than solely from information in existing plans.
Estimate the quantity for variable thickness bid items using the estimated variable thickness area multiplied by a thickness of 2-in.
Variable thickness is the depth of removal that exceeds the uniform removal depth. As the name suggest, this will not be a fixed dimension, and determining an accurate average depth is impossible. The value used to estimate the variable depth pay quantity should be reasonable to avoid significant changes in the character of the work. Therefore, to keep the estimate simple, reasonable, and consistent, an average depth of variable thickness of 2-in is recommended.
Estimate the quantity for the Hand chipping bid items as 10% of the estimated variable thickness area.
Estimate the quantity for full depth repair bid item as the estimated area of full depth repair multiplied by the remaining deck thickness after uniform and variable removal (where applicable).
Overlays using hydrodemolition, may have excessive removal and some “blow-through” may be expected.
Consideration shall be given to adding a plan note and quantity requiring falsework to be placed over traffic prior to performing the hydrodemolition.
Do not include a pay item for full depth repair when no full depth repair is anticipated.
403.4.1.1 483BLATEX MODIFIED (LMC) C403.4.1.1
The minimum thickness of a Latex Modified concrete overlay is 1.25-in.
LMC materials are batched on-site. The internal structure of the LMC overlay creates a surface with similar permeability as MSC. LMC has a lower elastic modulus than MSC and SDC making it more resistant to cracking than the other two materials. LMC is the most expensive of the three standard rigid overlay materials with a 25% premium over the average combined cost of MSC and SDC materials.
LMC is a good alternative for remote locations due to on site mixing requirements. LMC is not pumpable, and the mobile mixing trucks need to have access to the screed machine. In some instances, the mobile mixers will drive over areas of exposed concrete reinforcement.
The maximum uniform thickness should not exceed 2.5-in. The maximum spot thickness should not exceed 4-in.
Latex-Modified overlays should not be used of bridges with a grade greater than 6%.
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025
4-17
LCM may be best suited for second-generation overlays, due to the difficulty of removal from the original concrete deck.
403.4.1.2 484BMICRO-SILICA MODIFIED (MSC) C403.4.1.2
The minimum thickness of a Micro-Silica Modified concrete overlay is 1.5-in.
MSC materials are batched at a ready-mix facility. The internal structure of the MSC overlay creates a surface with a lower permeability than SDC.
MSC overlays are the most susceptible to plastic shrinkage cracking under improper placement and curing conditions.
MSC overlay are a good choice for uniform removals with minimal variable depth removal. The maximum uniform thickness should not exceed 3-in and the maximum spot thickness should not exceed 4-in. Thicker MSC overlays will be susceptible to shrinkage cracking.
Micro-silica concretes are very cohesive and behave somewhat differently than conventional concrete in that they are internally very sticky and need a water reducer. Slumps need to be at maximum allowable to achieve the same workability.
403.4.1.3 485BSUPERPLASTICIZED DENSE (SDC) C403.4.1.3
The minimum thickness of a Superplasticized Dense concrete overlay is 1.75-in.
SDC materials are batched at a ready-mix facility and are the least complicated for contractors to place and cure.
SDC overlays are best suited for decks with high quantities of deck patching and full depth repairs. There is no maximum limit to the uniform or spot thickness. For a uniform overlay thickness exceeding 5-in, place a 12 x 12 – D12 x D12 epoxy coated or galvanized welded wire reinforcement (WWR) with a 2.5-in minimum cover to the top surface and 1.5-in minimum cover to the prepared surface. The WWR will provide shrinkage and temperature control reinforcement to help control cracking in the overlay.
403.4.2 321BTHIN EPOXY C403.4.2
The minimum thickness of an Epoxy overlay is 0.25-in. Depressions in the deck surface less than 1.5-in can be filled with a mortar made from Polymer Epoxy Overlay material.  If depressions in the deck are greater than 1.5-in, add a quantity for deck patching. The Department will pay for repairing these depressions under ITEM 519 – PATCHING CONCRETE BRIDGE DECKS.
Seal cracks with a width greater than 13 mills per
Thin Polymer Epoxy Overlays are used as a deck preservation methodology. They serve to seal the deck from chloride intrusion, seal cracks, and to increase surface friction. Thin bonded overlays can aid in minor grade corrections.
This treatment is appropriate for candidates with a deck General Condition Rating of 6 or greater showing signs of cracking but requiring minimal repair.

C&amp;MS 512.07, Sealing Cracks by Epoxy Injection. The Department will pay for these crack repairs under ITEM 512 – CONCRETE REPAIR BY EPOXY INJECTION.
Minor grade correction required to fill low spots and improve drainage will require additional polymer epoxy overlay courses not covered by the specification. The limits of and number of additional courses shall be specified in the contract plans. Use pay item as per plan, when specifying addition courses
SS858 Thin Polymer (Epoxy) Overlays for Structural Slabs overlays includes the following repair areas:
A. Concrete bridge decks
B. Top of backwalls C. Approach slabs
D. Barriers/curbs 3-in above the deck
If additional areas are to be repaired with thin epoxy, add a note to the plans and change the pay item to include “AS PER PLAN”
For bridge decks with an existing thin epoxy overlay to be removed, include pay ITEM 202 – WEARING CORSE REMOVED, AS PER PLAN (units square yard).
A typical General Note is available in BDM Section 603.2 - ITEM 202 - WEARING COURSE REMOVED, AS PER PLAN: REMOVE THE EXISTING EPOXY WEARING SURFACE BY MICRO-MILLING.
403.4.3 322BWATERPROOFING ASPHALT C403.4.3
Perform work in accordance with SS856.
Do not specify waterproofing fabric or similar under the Waterproofing Asphalt.
The minimum thickness of the Waterproofing Asphalt course is 1.5-in.
This work shall be performed on projects with a completion date prior to November 1st. Waterproofing Asphalt is a consideration for overlay replacements for existing asphalt overlays on bridge decks and non-composite box beam superstructures. When specified at the minimum thickness, Waterproofing Asphalt, not including costs of removing an existing overlay, is about one-third of the average combined cost of a typical waterproofing membrane and asphalt overlay.
Existing asphalt overlay does not require complete removal. Depth of asphalt removed should be based upon existing asphalt overlay condition and whether the structure is capable of additional load from the asphalt.

403.5 128BDECK REPLACEMENT C403.5
Perform removal of existing decks using methods that will not damage supporting superstructure members. Refer to BDM Section 603.2 for sample General Notes that address appropriate deck removal methods.
Use a composite deck design to increase the load carrying capacity of existing beams or girders when replacing the concrete deck of a bridge that was originally designed and constructed as non-composite. See BDM Section 404.1.6 for additional information.
For bridges on curved alignments where shoulders are used to maintain traffic, provide temporary modifications to cross-slopes oriented in the wrong direction. Address this issue in the Narrative of Bridge Alternatives and Preliminary Maintenance of Traffic Plan submitted during the Structure Type Study.
For some bridges, the shoulder on the high side of the superelevated section will be sloped downward towards the railing to prevent surface water from crossing the travel lanes. Maintaining temporary lanes on a shoulder sloping towards the railing on the outside of a curve may present a safety concern that should be avoided.
During plan development, record elevations at key points along the bottom of all beams/girders (e.g. above beam seats; at quarter points, mid-span points and splice points; and at intermediate points not to exceed 25-ft). Verify this elevation information against the proposed profile grade and deck surface elevations to ensure the minimum deck thickness and determine haunch heights.
Specify that elevations at these same points be recorded during construction before and after the deck removal. The difference in these elevations becomes the superstructure rebound. Multiply this rebound by the per foot weight of the proposed deck and divide by the per foot weight of the existing deck to determine the deflection due to deck placement. Add this deflection to the Final Deck Surface Elevations to get Screed Elevations. Add this deflection to the Final Deck Surface Elevations and subtract the design deck thickness to get Top of Haunch elevations. Provide a table in the plans similar to that shown in BDM Section C403.5 with known information supplied that allows the contractor to complete during construction.

403.5.1 323BELIMINATION OF LONGITUDINAL DECK JOINT
C403.5.1
If the total bridge width will be 90-ft or less, eliminate existing longitudinal deck joints. When the longitudinal joint is eliminated, replace structural steel bearings (e.g. rockers and bolsters) with elastomeric bearings.
When the decks of twin structures without elastomeric bearings are being tied together resulting in a total structure width in excess of 60-ft, replace the existing bearings with elastomeric bearings.
This measurement for bridge width assumes the joint has been removed.
When the joint is removed, transverse movement due to expansion and contraction will be increased. This additional movement cannot be accommodated by rockers and bolsters.
403.5.2 324BDECK HAUNCH C403.5.2
The minimum haunch above an existing beam/girder is 0.0-in.
Refer to BDM Section 403.5 for information ensuring minimum deck thickness.
When the haunch is used to provide an increase in the profile elevations, reinforce the haunch in areas where the top of the stud does not penetrate at least 2.0-in into the design deck thickness. The maximum stud length shall not exceed 8.5-in. Refer to BDM Figure 308-8 for I-beam haunch reinforcement and BDM Figure 403-1 for steel beam/girder haunch reinforcement.
The purpose for the haunch reinforcement is to avoid a horizontal shear plane between the top flange and the bottom of the deck and to reduce the size of concrete spall if concrete deteriorates with age.

403.5.3 325BCLOSURE POUR C403.5.3
Do not provide a closure pour between adjacent phases of deck placement on an existing superstructure where cross-frames or diaphragms remain fully connected between all phases.
Fully connected cross-frames in the bay separating phases will resist differential deflections between the phases.
For deck replacements that include integral and semi-integral diaphragms cast against the diaphragms from the in preceding phases, the concrete in the diaphragm shall remain plastic during placement of the deck concrete in the adjacent span. Use either plan note [702.4.2-2] or [702.4.2-4] in BDM Section 702.4.2.
If the diaphragm for the deck phase being placed sets against the preceding phase diaphragm, it will resist the deflection of the superstructure members supporting that phase of deck placement. This can lead to excessive stresses and insufficient cover/deck thickness.
Seal the phase joint with HMWM in accordance with C&amp;MS 511.
Refer to BDM Section 403.6.1 for closure pour requirements in widening projects.
403.5.4 326BCONCRETE PLACEMENT SEQUENCE
C403.5.4
Provide a concrete placement sequence for superstructures subjected to uplift.
Without a plan sequence, the Contractor is free to place the deck that best suits their means and methods.
Uplift can become an issue where the end spans of a continuous structure are less than 60% of the adjacent interior span.
For bridges with intermediate hinges and expansion joints, provide a concrete placement sequence in the plans.
Long multiple span steel beam and girder bridges have, in the past, been subdivided into units by means of intermediate expansion joints, located at points of contraflexure, to keep expansion and contraction within the capacities of bearing devices and expansion joints. The hinged structure is more sensitive to placement of deck slab concrete than a fully continuous structure. This sensitivity requires that the sequence of deck concrete placement be carefully planned because (1) the configuration of most intermediate joints makes them susceptible to damage if the deck placement sequence results in large angle changes between the articulated elements of the joints, and (2) the development of composite action in previously placed spans may cause deflections to vary from design deflections and result in a rough profile.
Generally, concrete should be placed on the long cantilever before concrete is placed on the short cantilever, particularly before placement in the span contiguous with the short cantilever.
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025
4-23
The most unsatisfactory sequence is to first place concrete in the span contiguous with the short cantilever, especially if concrete is first placed in half of the span immediately adjoining the short cantilever. This sequence produces the maximum angle change between the joint elements.
Where controlled deck placement sequence alone will not provide adequate protection against damage to the joint, provision should be made for attaching part or all of the joint to the main structural elements after the major portion of the concrete is placed. Another alternative is to have a separate deck pour of approximately 36-in, or of a width necessary to accommodate the joint and its proper placement/installation and alignment, to allow for installation of the joint after the rest of the deck has been placed.
403.6 129BWIDENING C403.6
Design the new beams/girders for widened bridges to have the same dead load deflections (± 0.25-in) as the adjacent existing beam/girder.
Deflections that differ between adjacent beams/girders will affect deck thickness and concrete cover. These differential deflections will also provide additional loading to bracing members and connections.
403.6.1 327BCLOSURE POUR C403.6.1
Provide closure pours for widened superstructures constructed in phases as follows:
The purpose of the closure pour is to accommodate the differences in deflection that can occur between two phases of construction.
A. For widened bridges where the existing deck is removed, and a new or wider deck is to be placed with no superstructure members added, no closure pour is necessary. Refer to Detail A in BDM Figure 403-2.
B. For widenings where either the existing deck is to remain, or the phase line of a new deck will be between the existing and new superstructure, provide a closure pour in the bay between the new and existing beams/girders. Refer to Detail B in BDM Figure 403-2. Do not fully connect cross-frames (designated B1 in BDM Figure 403-2) in the bay between the new and existing superstructure until after the phase 1 and 2 deck portions have been placed. Complete the phase 3 placement after the cross-frames have been fully connected. Splice rebar within the closure section.
C. For widenings where the deck’s phase line is not between the new and existing superstructure members, provide a closure pour in the bay between the phases. Refer to Detail C in BDM Figure 403-2. Disconnect the existing cross-frames (designated C1 in BDM Figure 403-2) under the closure pour location before the phase 1 deck removal begins.
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025
4-24
Install the cross-frames between the new and existing beams/girders before the phase 2 pour. Re-install the disconnected cross-frames after the phase 2 pour but before the phase 3 pour. Splice rebar within the closure section.
Figure 403-2
The minimum width of the closure section shall be 30-in.
The 30-in dimension accommodates a lap length and provides some transition if the two phases do not align vertically.
Closure pours may be eliminated if the differential deflection is expected to be less than 1/4-in, regardless of superstructure type.
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025
4-25
Seal all construction joints with HMWM according to C&amp;MS 511.19.
Forms and falseworks for decks and slabs constructed in phases shall be independent from the adjacent phase of construction.
The forms shall not span across the closure pour until all cross-frames are fully connected following the sequencing specified above.
For superstructure deflections refer to BDM Section 404.2.
403.7 130BEXPANSION JOINTS C403.7
Inspect joints for water tightness during the development of rigid overlay plans and repair leaking joints.
Keeping a leaking joint system in place may lead to unnecessary emergency repairs in the future.
Remove and replace joint systems during deck replacements according to the applicable Standard Bridge Drawing.
Trying to keep existing expansion joint systems when replacing the deck may lead to unnecessary cost for removal operations, or more likely, irreparable damage to the joint system.
For widened superstructures, extend the joint armor and furnish new joint seal in one continuous piece or remove and replace the entire existing joints systems according to the applicable Standard Bridge Drawing.
If the existing joint system is leaking or if it is a sliding plate type joint system, replacement of the entire joint is more appropriate than trying to provide an extended sliding plate joint system.
On projects involving stage construction, provide the location of armor joints in the plans.
Many designers consider the detailing of joints to be of secondary importance and merely a nuisance. However improper detailing of joints has frequently caused project delays and caused numerous problems. The joints are important to the longevity of the structure or they would not be included in the work. Designers shall take care to ensure that they are designed and detailed in a professional manner.
403.7.1 328BSTRIP SEAL REPLACEMENT C403.7.1
For existing strip seal joints which show sign of leakage, identify the joint supplier and specify seal removal and replacement with seal of the same geometry.
It may not always be possible to replace an existing joint seal. In rare cases, the existing seals will still have the manufacturer name visible. More often, it is more practical to contact joint seal suppliers for technical assistance. Sometimes, the suppliers may be able to determine the seal model by a photograph of the seal cross section taken at the joint upturns. If the seal is no longer available or if the joint retainers are damaged, removal of the retainers and installation of adhesive joint seals should be considered.

403.7.2 329BVERTICAL JOINT EXTENSION C403.7.2
For existing sliding plate joints, attach steel retainers on roadway surface of sliding plates according to BDM Figure 403-3.
Existing sliding plate joints typically end at the curb and toe of concrete bridge railings. The joint armor and steel retainers will need to be extended and bent up the face of the curb or concrete railing. Develop plan details that show existing concrete removals, attachment methods for new steel armor to existing steel, new concrete anchorages, retainer attachments, finished concrete dimensions, concrete reinforcement bar marks and schedule, material requirements and coating requirements. Provide section views from the centerline of the joint looking toward the deck and the backwall, a plan view and cross-section views. Make sure all work is clearly defined and associated with an Item for payment.
This joint repair may not provide sufficient clearance for the larger joint seal installations. Contact seal suppliers to ensure the proposed details will allow installation.

403.7.3 330BADHESIVE JOINT SEALS C403.7.3
For existing sliding plate joints, remove the horizontal leg of the bridging angle and install an adhesive joint seal according to the manufacturer’s recommendations and the Scope of Services.
For existing joint systems with leaking seals and damaged retainers, remove the retainers and install an adhesive joint seal according to the manufacture’s recommendations and the Scope of Services.
There are many different adhesive joint systems in the marketplace including strip seals and compression seals. Unless otherwise stated in the Scope of Services, contact multiple joint system suppliers to determine the adhesive joint system that best fits the project requirements.
403.8 131BRAISING &amp; JACKING C403.8
Raise the bridge uniformly in order to minimize induced stresses into the superstructure. The maximum differential elevation change between adjacent superstructure members is ¼-in as measured at opposite ends of the same cross-frame. The maximum differential elevation change between adjacent bearings of the same superstructure member is 1-in. Perform work in accordance with C&amp;MS 501.05.B.5.
Use structural steel to raise the bearing seat elevation 4-in or less.
If the seat elevation will be raised more than 4-in, consider adding a reinforced concrete extension to the existing bearing seat.
403.9 132B RIDGE DRAINAGE C403.9
Retrofit all non-functional drainage systems. Provide replacement drainage according to BDM Section 309.7.
Damage often occurs to existing bridges as a result of poorly designed drainage. Proper drainage is extremely important to the longevity of the structure.
Perform pavement drainage calculations according to the L&amp;D, Vol. 2. If the calculations indicate that the existing scuppers are not necessary, and the deck is not to be replaced, permanently plug the existing scuppers and collect the additional drainage at the end of the bridge. If the deck is to be replaced, remove the scuppers and grind all scupper weld locations smooth.
Extend the lower portion of existing scuppers to remain so that they terminate at least 8-in below the bottom of the bottom flange. Remove and repair or completely replace existing scuppers with extensive section loss due to corrosion.
For overlay projects, extend existing scuppers to remain upward by the thickness of the overlay.
This avoids a potential for hazard presented by the drop in surface elevation at the scupper locations.

This railing system is commonly referred to as the GM barrier.
The GM barrier does not meet the minimum TL-3 acceptance criteria in either NCHRP Report 350 or MASH.
The GM barrier was developed by General Motors in conjunction with the Texas Transportation Institute using full scale crash testing of large passenger cars in the 1960’s. By the early 1970’s, there was ample evidence that impacts involving compact passenger cars often resulted in roll over. By the mid-to-late 1970’s the use of the GM barrier was discontinued across the U.S.
The GM barrier has not been tested nor evaluated to either NCHRP Report 350 or MASH acceptance criteria.
BR-1-67 was the ODOT standard concrete railing for bridges until it was replaced by BR-1 in 1979.

The original version of TST-1-99, dated 07-06-99, included a modified Type 3 Bridge Terminal Assembly that connected to the bridge railing at two W6x25 posts spaced at 1.5-ft located off of the end of the bridge. This assembly did not utilize a terminal connector at the end of the thrie beam. For projects that include this original detail, connect the thrie beam as shown in the original TST-1-99 drawing using either Roadway Plan Insert Sheet GR-3.6 or Roadway Standard Construction Drawing MGS-3.1, as appropriate, without the terminal connector.

C403.10.2
If the existing railing on the bridge to be rehabilitated is not one of the standard systems detailed in BDM Section 403.10.1, determine if the railing system is based on the design of a successfully tested railing system.
A listing of railing systems that have been accepted for use on the NHS is provided on the FHWA Office of Safety – Roadway Departure Safety website.
Railing systems that are accepted to NCHRP Report 350 or MASH TL-3 or better, do not need to be replaced when the deck supporting this railing system will be rehabilitated using a rigid overlay specified in BDM Section 403.4.1. Otherwise, the railing system shall be removed and replaced with railing meeting the design requirements specified in BDM Section 309.4 when the deck supporting this railing system will be rehabilitated using a rigid overlay specified in BDM Section 403.4.1.
Portions of railing systems that are accepted to NCHRP Report 350 or MASH TL-3 or better with a condition rating of 3 or 4 shall be removed and replaced in kind regardless of the length of deficiency. Otherwise, portions of the railing systems shall be rehabilitated as follows:
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025

A. Where the railing system with a condition rating of 3 or 4 is 20% or less than the total length of railing, this portion of the railing shall be removed and replaced in kind.
B. Where the railing system with a condition rating of 3 or 4 exceeds 20% of the total length of railing, the entire railing shall be removed and replaced with railing meeting the design requirements specified in BDM Section 309.4.
For construction projects not involving the complete replacement of existing bridge railing, a mechanical connection between the approach guardrail and the bridge railing is required.
403.11 134B EARINGS C403.11
Do not use compressible bearings in combination with sliding plate expansion joints.
If compressible type bearings are used in this situation, the bearing’s reaction will be transferred to the bridging angle on the expansion joint causing distress to the end of the deck and top of backwall.
All bearings at an individual substructure unit shall be the same type. The bearings at any one substructure unit shall be compatible with all the bearings at the other substructure units.

Only use this bearing type in rehabilitation projects where a match to the existing bearing is required.
This bearing is limited to a 2-in factored movement in one direction from the vertical.
Bevel the upper load plate to match the profile grade for structures where the grade at the bearing is greater than 2 percent. Provide a plan detail of the beveled, upper load plate. The thickness of the upper load plate at the centerline of the bearing (dimension C in the standard drawing) shall be held.
This bearing type is presented on Standard Bridge Drawing RB-1-55. The standard drawing also includes maximum load capacity requirements (Service Load I) for this bearing type.
The assumed nominal rolling and sliding resistance of rockers is 0.25*DL times r/R, where: DL is the dead load reaction on the rockers, “r” is the radius of the pin, in inches, and “R” is the radius of the rocker, in inches.
Pier and abutment seats will allow the bearing base plate to achieve full seat area.
The maximum clip shall not remove more than 3-in2 of bearing base plate surface area. Investigate that the substructure can accept the increased loading.
The designer may choose, on structures of extreme skew, the alternative of clipping the corner of the bearing plate to save adding additional width to the pier and abutment seats.
403.11.2 334BSLIDING BRONZE TYPE &amp; FIXED TYPE STEEL BEARINGS

When it is necessary to repair a section of a steel member that has been damaged by rust or other means the specifics of the repair details are left to the ingenuity of the designer due to the vast number of possible solutions. When a beam is damaged by a vehicle impact refer to plan insert sheets CRHS for repair techniques. Repairing beams by heat straightening is discussed in BDM Section 404.1.8.
When performing welded repairs in compression zones, ensure the chemistry of the existing steel is such that it can be welded. Perform field non-destructive testing (NDT) on the welds. Specify weld procedures, the type and location of the NDT, and other relevant information in the plan notes.
Review old mill certifications or take samples of the base material for chemical analysis to determine the existing material composition.
Do not perform welded repairs in tension zones. Repair damaged sections in tension zones by bolting new steel to existing steel.
If it is absolutely necessary to perform welded repairs in a tension zone, consult the Office of Structural Engineering for recommendations.

404.1.2 336BFATIGUE
404.1.2.1 489BGENERAL C404.1.2.1
Fatigue damage, as it pertains to bridges, is categorized as due to either load-induced or distortion-induced (displacement-induced) stresses. Both types of damage are actually load-induced, the former is directly related to the application of live load and the resulting stresses (in plane), while the latter is the result of secondary stresses (out of plane) typically transmitted by a secondary member as it tends to change the shape of, or distort, the primary member because of displacement. Load-induced damage is dependent on stress range, type of detail, and the number of applications of live load and can be accounted for during design. Distortion-induced damage is not directly quantified in the design of a bridge but can be minimized through proper detailing. Two conditions are necessary for distortion-induced damage to occur: a periodic out-of-plane force or displacement; and an abrupt local change in stiffness where the force/displacement is applied.
Only load-induced fatigue is directly addressed by this section. Since the repairs for distortion-induced fatigue damage are specifically dependent upon the existing detail itself, the repair details are largely up to the designer; are beyond the scope of this section; and may require a special analysis. The designer should consult with the Office of Structural Engineering when developing these types of repairs.
For clarity, the following terms are used as defined throughout BDM Section 0. A “moment plate” is an existing plate welded to the flanges of a member with the purpose of strengthening the section. A moment plate does not connect members together. A “coverplate” is an existing plate that is welded to the flanges of the section to connect two members together.
Repair or retrofit the detail if cracks are detected.
Retrofit all E or and E’ details on fracture critical members.
404.1.2.2 490BFATIGUE EVALUATION C404.1.2.2
Perform a fatigue evaluation of existing steel members/details to be re-used or rehabilitated. The evaluation consists of screening the member/detail and performing a remaining fatigue life analysis when necessary.
In addition to the field survey of the structure as required by BDM Section 401.1, during the Structure Type Study, conduct a detailed arm’s length survey of the bridge’s fatigue-prone details to be evaluated. Also review the bridge inspection records to ascertain if cracking was noted during an inspection.
Bridge inspection records will be available from the District or online at <a href="http://biareports.dot.state.oh.us/">http://biareports.dot.state.oh.us/</a>.
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025

Submit a fatigue evaluation report to the Department, as part of the Structure Type Study, with recommendations as to whether the members require fatigue related upgrading.
404.1.2.3 491BDETAILS TO CONSIDER C404.1.2.3
Evaluate longitudinal rolled steel beams/welded steel girders having welded moment plates in the positive or negative moment regions, transverse floor beams with welded moment plates, and/or Beam Continuity Welds with and without coverplates.
Do not evaluate base metal of rolled beams, welded plate girders without moment plates, cross-frames, cross-frame connections to beams/girders, transverse web stiffeners, longitudinal web stiffeners, lateral bracing, uncracked web welds, riveted members and riveted connections except if member shows signs of distress or is required by the Scope of Services.
If the element of concern has experienced severe corrosion, mechanical damage, or previously repaired fatigue damage it is recommended the detail be replaced during a rehabilitation project.
404.1.2.4 492BEVALUATION PROCESS C404.1.2.4
Use the following retrofitting specifications when evaluating the re-use of the existing steel beams/girders for deck replacement projects.
Complete an economic analysis comparing the cost of utilizing the existing steel members with all associated repairs, retrofitting, strengthening, painting, and widening issues considered, versus superstructure replacement to justify the decision to retrofit.
For the economic analysis, use $10.00 per pound (in 2019 dollars) for the estimated cost of “Structural Steel Repair”.
For an estimation of the weight of steel required for the retrofit, the plate sizes from the retired Bolted Splice Standard Drawing (Standard Bridge Drawing BS-1-93, sheet 2 of 3) may be used with the resulting weight increased by 25 percent if the web is not to be retrofitted and with no increase if the web is to be retrofit. When using the standard drawing, no deduction for bolt holes is necessary. The cost estimate should be based on initial cost.

404.1.2.4.b 590B EAM CONTINUITY WELDS WITH COVERPLATES
C404.1.2.4.b
When Ohio began using the concept of continuous spans, one commonly used standard detail is a fatigue concern. The detail consisted of simple span rolled beams butt welded together at the piers with short plates welded to the top and bottom flanges, roughly centered on the piers. The weld line of the beam webs had coped holes at the top and bottom flange, serving as access holes for the flange welds. The plates are not structural in that they are not serving the part of moment plates and were meant to reinforce the welded flanges, using a “belt and suspenders” logic. These details are illustrated on retired Standard Bridge Drawing SD-1-63, sheet 1, and were generally used with the rolled beams shown in retired Standard Bridge Drawing CSB-1-63. When beams of differing depths were used, the web of the shorter beam was cut horizontally, and its flange was raised to match the depth of the adjacent beam and the gap in the web was then filled with weld. This method of joining typically resulted in the top splice plate being kinked or bent at the center of the pier.
Henceforth, the butt welds detailed in “Beam Splice Detail A” and “Beam Splice Detail B” on sheet 1 of retired standard drawing SD-1-63 will be referred to as the “Beam Continuity Weld” throughout BDM Section 404.
A. Retrofit the top coverplate of the Beam Continuity Weld, without performing remaining fatigue life calculations, when:</li>
<li>The bridge is known to contain fatigue cracks in either the weld of the flange plate or the primary member.
Place a plan note in the contract plans describing how the contractor is to inspect the top flange plate welds for cracks after the deck has been removed. Also define in the plan note how the retrofit of the top flange plate will be paid in the event that cracks are found in the top flange plate welds.</li>
<li>The bridge is located on principal arterial roads (interstate, other freeways or express ways) [functional classifications 01 and 02].
Functional classification maps can be obtained from the Office of Technical Services website.
The ends of bottom flange coverplates of the Beam Continuity Weld do not require automatic retrofit. Perform a remaining fatigue life analysis per BDM Section 404.1.2.6 to determine if a retrofit is warranted.
In most cases the stress range at this location will meet the requirements of MBE 7.2.3 or MBE 7.2.4 and a retrofit will not be required.

B. Conduct a remaining fatigue life analysis, BDM Section 404.1.2.6, on bridges with a present day single lane ADTT (Average Daily Truck Traffic) exceeding 1000 trucks.
The 1000 truck ADTT limit for a single lane was set based on the belief that the bridges that do not meet this criterion will have sufficient fatigue capacity for the remaining life of the superstructure. When the deck is converted from non-composite to composite deck the stress ranges at the areas of concern is reduced enough to provide a remaining fatigue life in excess of 20 years.
Retrofitting is not required when the remaining fatigue life is at least 20 years.
Retrofit both ends of a plate when the remaining fatigue life at either end is less than 20 years. Conduct an economic analysis as detailed herein.
Retrofit the top coverplate of the Beam Continuity Weld at the centerline of the splice (i.e. the location of the flange to flange weld) when retrofitting the ends of coverplates. Refer to BDM Figure 404-2.
Retrofit web welds only when the web is cracked.  C. Bridges not meeting the requirements of (A) or (B)

404.1.2.5 493BCLASSIFICATION OF DETAILS C404.1.2.5
Classify the ends of moment plates and ends of Beam Continuity Weld coverplates as either an E or E’ detail.
In order to qualify as a Category E detail, all of the following criteria must be met, otherwise it is to be classified as a Category E’ detail:
A. The thickness of the welded plate must be less than 1.0-in
AND
B. The thickness of the top flange of rolled beam must be less than or equal to 0.8-in
AND
C. The welded plate is narrower than the beam flange (with or without welds across the ends of the plate) or the welded plate is wider than the beam flange with welds across the ends of the plate.
For the purpose of a remaining life analysis, evaluate Beam Continuity Welds, riveted built-up sections, riveted members and riveted connections based upon the requirements of a Category C detail.
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025

For the purpose of a remaining life analysis, the complete penetration flange weld of the Beam Continuity Weld is to be evaluated based upon the requirements of a Category C detail.
A complete penetration flange weld is typically classified as a Category B detail. However, due to the typical poor weld quality and the lack of testing of the Beam Continuity Welds the Department requires this detail to be analyzed as a Category C detail.
<em>Classify all other details according to LRFD Table 6.6.1.2.3-1.</em>
404.1.2.6 494BREMAINING FATIGUE LIFE ANALYSIS
C404.1.2.6
Except as noted in BDM Section 404.1.2.4 or the Scope of Services perform remaining fatigue life analyses only on fatigue-prone details.
<em>Fatigue-prone details are all details that fall within Categories D, E, or E’ of LRFD Table 6.6.1.2.3-1.</em>
If a detail falls within the categories listed above but meets the requirements of MBE 7.2.3, the detail may be considered as not fatigue-prone and a remaining fatigue life analysis is not required for that detail.
Prior to completing the remaining fatigue life analysis detailed below perform an infinite-life check. If the detail meets the infinite-life check no retrofit is required.
Refer to MBE 7.2.4 for guidance on the infinite-life check.
Calculate the remaining fatigue life of the fatigue-prone detail per MBE 7.2.5.
When determining the expected annual growth rate, unless traffic information has been provided by the Department, refer to the ODOT Traffic Monitoring Management System (TMMS) for applicable traffic information. Use all the available traffic data to determine the expected annual growth rate by calculating the average growth rate. For cases when the growth rate is zero or negative, use a very small number for the growth rate (e.g. 0.0001). If historical traffic data is not available use an assumed annual growth rate of 5%.
For the average number of trucks per day in a single lane in the first year the detail was in service (ADTTSL)0), if historical truck data is not available use the (ADTTSL)PRESENT
Unless otherwise stated in the Scope of Services use Evaluation 2 resistance factors.
When the effective stress range is determined using the factored calculated stress range due to the passage of the fatigue truck, use the stress range for an interior beam. The Department does not believe that the stress range on the exterior beams for each fatigue truck passage is accurately represented using the LRFD distribution factors.

404.1.3.7 502BFATIGUE CRACKS IN OTHER MEMBERS AND DETAILS
C404.1.3.7
Since the repair of fatigue cracks in members and details is dependent on the specifics of a situation, it is not practical to provide specific guidelines or repair details, so only a general discussion will be made. To properly devise a repair scheme, it must be determined if the crack resulted from load-induced or distortion-induced stresses. The source of the cracking should also be identified. More than one factor could contribute to cracking. Defects from poor fabrication may need to be considered. Cracking can also occur during shipment and/or erection. The retrofit may need to include modifying the stiffness of an existing connection. The repair should be logically thought out and its influence on the other steel members investigated. A poorly designed repair may worsen the situation as repaired cracks can reinitiate and propagate further into the member, the repair detail itself may experience cracking and new cracking may occur elsewhere if load patterns were modified or member response to loads has been modified.
404.1.4 338B OX GIRDER PIER CAPS RETROFIT
C404.1.4
Retrofit box girders only when cracking is evident. Often box girders were constructed using non-continuous back-up bars that were stitch welded in place. The discontinuity in the back-up bar is of major concern since it acts like a crack in the member and may be a source of crack propagation into the flange or web. The stitch welds may or may not be a problem depending on the stress ranges at their location.

The Office of Structural Engineering may be contacted for assistance in determining the best retrofit for specific details.
404.1.6 340BSTRENGTHENING OF STRUCTURAL STEEL MEMBERS
C404.1.6
<em>Install welded stud shear connectors the full length on all steel beam or girder bridges in which the deck is being removed and replaced. Design the stud spacing in accordance with LRFD 6.10.10.</em>
Perform field welding and non-destructive testing (NDT) in strict compliance with AWS Specifications, S1011 and the C&amp;MS. Specify the type and location of the NDT in the plans. Do not specify overhead welding in the plans.
Bolted plates in tension zones or compression zones can be used to increase strength.
Consider jacking the stringers to relieve stresses prior to installing cover plates. In this manner the cover plates will carry dead load and live load stresses. If the plates are installed without relieving the stresses, they will carry live load only. This is merely a suggestion as to how extra strength might be obtained if it is needed.
Other methods of increasing the strength are to attach angles or structural shapes to the web or flanges. The possibilities are numerous and is left to the ingenuity of the designer. However, pay strict attention to practicality as well as strength and fatigue requirements. Consult the Office of Structural Engineering for recommendations or to review unusual details before proceeding.
When retrofitting or repairing truss members, provide temporary support where needed.
Many truss members are non-redundant, and their removal could result in the collapse of the structure.
404.1.7 341BTRIMMING BEAM ENDS C404.1.7
Provide Plan and Elevation views in the plans showing where the beam is to be cut. Also provide pertinent notes and include the work with ITEM 513 - TRIMMING OF BEAM ENDS for payment. Pay attention to the clearance to the end cross-frames and detail their removal and replacement if necessary.
Trimming of beam ends is sometimes necessary due to tilting of the abutment and closure of the end dam.
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025
4-54
In lieu of trimming the beam ends, consider modifying the backwall if backwall removal and replacement is being performed as part of the work. Modifying the backwall would be a viable option if it were necessary to remove and replace the end cross-frames as a result of trimming the beam ends. Another option to consider is converting the existing abutment into a semi-integral abutment as discussed in BDM Sections 404.6 and 405.7.
404.1.8 342BHEAT STRAIGHTENING C404.1.8
Do not heat straighten fracture critical members.
Provide details showing the location of all repairs and include Item 513 pay items for repair of damaged members.
Beams or girders that have been struck by trucks or bent by other causes can often be repaired by heat straightening only, or in combination with field welding to install new sections for the damaged steel member portions. The District Bridge Engineer or other ODOT representative with experience in heat straightening should assess the practicality of this type of repair before proceeding. If heat straightening is deemed to be practical, SS849 is available which describes and controls the operation. Refer to the SS849 Designer Notes for more information. Refer to Plan Insert Sheet CRHS for repair and heat straightening details.
404.1.9 343BHINGE ASSEMBLIES C404.1.9
Consideration should be given to removing hinges and making the members continuous.
If the hinge cannot be removed, consideration should be given to the need of providing redundancy in the event of a hinge failure or seismic event.
If a pin and hanger assembly is to be rehabilitated, consult the Office of Structural Engineering for recommendations, including suggested lubrication and NDT requirements.
404.1.10 344B OLTS C404.1.10
<em>The Department will permit oversize and slotted holes rehabilitation work. Design oversize and slotted holes in accordance with LRFD 6.13.2.4. Design connections as slip critical.</em>
Oversize or slotted holes may be desirable in some remedial applications especially where the fit of repair or replacement members or parts becomes tedious.
Since all C&amp;MS requirements are for standard size holes, specify requirements for the holes and necessary washers in the plans.
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025
4-55
The Department will accept the use of blind fasteners (e.g. Huck Bolts) when clearance problems arise. Since the installation specifications in the C&amp;MS deal strictly with the installation and testing of normal high strength bolts, if blind fasteners are specified, modify the installation specifications by plan note.
404.1.11 345BEXISTING STEEL COATING SYSTEMS
C404.1.11
If the total existing structure is to be field painted, the coating should be a three-coat paint system consisting of an organic zinc prime coat, an epoxy intermediate coat and a urethane finish coat (formerly referred to as system OZEU) according to C&amp;MS 514. The OZEU system is better for field application on existing steel since the organic zinc prime coat is more surface-tolerant.
For widened structures, the new steel shall be coated with the inorganic zinc prime coat in the shop and the existing steel shall receive the organic prime coat. The intermediate and finish coats are the same for each system. Refer to BDM Section 308.2.2.1.d for additional coating information.
Field metallizing is another option, but its costs are typically more than twice the cost of OZEU.
When estimating the quantity for ITEM 514 - GRINDING FINS, TEARS, SLIVERS ON EXISTING STRUCTURAL STEEL, provide 1 minute for each linear foot of beam/girder to be coated.
404.2 137BSUPERSTRUCTURE DEFLECTIONS
C404.2
Design the beams/girders of the widened section so that the live load deflections between the new and existing beams/girders at each end of a lateral bracing location does not exceed S/100. Where S is the center to center beam spacing measured in the direction of the lateral bracing.
An effort should be made to use a beam/girder section that closely matches the moment of inertia as the existing beams/girders to keep the relative deflections to a minimum.
404.3 138BPRESTRESSED CONCRETE I-BEAM
404.3.1 346BIMPACT DAMAGE C404.3.1
When a prestressed concrete I-beam has been damaged by impact, conduct a detailed survey of the bridge. Complete the survey so that sufficient information is obtained to perform a comprehensive load rating of the bridge’s current condition. For these requirements refer to BDM Section 900.
When the damage to the bridge/beam causes the bridge load rating to require a Design Exception in accordance with BDM Section 401.4, repair or replacement of the damaged elements is necessary.
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025
4-56
Design all bridge repairs requiring structural strengthening in accordance to C&amp;MS 501.05.
Numerous strategies have been developed to structurally repair damaged prestressed concrete beams. However, due to the uniqueness of each damage scenario the repair must be designed to suit each individual case.
404.3.1.1 503BCRACK REPAIR
Repair cracks, 7 to 100 mils in thickness, with epoxy injection per C&amp;MS 512.07.
404.3.1.2 504BCONCRETE PATCHING AND BEAM REPAIR
C404.3.1.2
When strengthening is not required, repair damaged beam(s) with the following repair techniques.
Repair spalls with concrete patching when the spall exposes the beam reinforcing. If the reinforcing is not exposed, seal the damaged portion(s) of the beam with an epoxy coating conforming to C&amp;MS 512.03.
When patching is required, patch the beam according to SS843, C&amp;MS 519, or C&amp;MS 520.
The Scope of Services will provide the patching specification based on the type and degree of concrete damage. Patching per SS843 will be used in most cases because it works well in overhead applications without requiring formwork. Patching per C&amp;MS 520 will likely only be cost effective if a large area of patching is required.
Confine the concrete patch with a Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) wrap. Install two layers of unidirectional FRP wrap. Orient the first layer of the FRP wrap parallel to the centerline of the beam. Install this layer on the bottom of the beam flange. Orient the second layer of the FRP wrap perpendicular to the beam centerline. Wrap the second layer of FRP transversely around the bottom flange and outside web of the beam. Install the both layers of FRP a minimum of 12-in beyond the concrete patching in the longitudinal direction. Refer to BDM Figure 404-3 for the limits of the FRP in the longitudinal and transverse direction. Seal all repaired beam area with an epoxy-urethane sealer per C&amp;MS 512.03.
The concrete patch and FRP wrap are not designed to strengthen beam. This application is only intended to provide corrosion protection for the reinforcement. Strengthening the beam with FRP will require a detail design based on the strengthening requirements of the repair.
The FRP repair may be completed with carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) or E-glass fiber reinforced polymer (EGFRP). However, CFRP is thinner and will be much easier to install in an overhead placement application. The ease of construction will likely offset the increased material cost of the CFRP relative to the EGFRP.
Install FRP wrap in accordance with PN519 – Composite Fiber Wrap System. However, if the repair is being conducted as described in this section the requirement for an Ohio Registered Engineer to prepare, sign, seal and date the cover sheet or submittal letter according to ORC 4733 and OAC 4733-35 is not mandatory.

404.3.1.3 505BDAMAGED BEAM REPLACEMENT CRITERA
C404.3.1.3
Independent of the bridge rating, replace the beam when the following damaged is observed during the bridge survey.
A. Over 25% of the strands have been lost. A strand is considered lost when the effective strand section is reduced by over 25% (e.g. 2 or more of the 7-wire strand bundle is broken).
B. The bottom flange is displaced from the horizontal position more than ½-in per 10-ft of girder length.
C. If the alignment of the girder has been permanently altered by the impact causing a bend point in the beam.
D. Abrupt lateral offset in the beams cross section indicating that stirrups have yielded.
An example of this type of failure would be when large cracks at the web-flange interface remain open indicating that the vertical reinforcing has yielded.
E. Concrete damage at harping point resulting in permanent loss of prestressing in the strand.
F. Severe concrete damage at girder ends resulting in permanent loss of prestressing in the strand.

404.4.1 347BIMPACT DAMAGE C404.4.1
When a prestressed concrete I-box beam has been damaged by impact, conduct a detailed survey of the bridge. Complete the survey so that sufficient information is obtained to perform a comprehensive rating of the bridge’s current condition. For these requirements refer to BDM Section 900.
When the damage to the bridge/beam causes the bridge load rating to require a Design Exception in accordance with BDM Section 401.4, repair or replacement of the damaged elements is necessary.

404.4.1.2 507BCONCRETE PATCHING AND BEAM REPAIR
C404.4.1.2
When strengthening is not required, repair damaged beam(s) with the following repair techniques.
Repair spalls with concrete patching when the spall exposes the beam reinforcing. If the reinforcing is not exposed, seal the damaged portion(s) of the beam with an epoxy coating conforming to C&amp;MS 512.03.

Patching per C&amp;MS 520 will likely only be cost effective if a large area of patching is required.
Confine the concrete patch with a Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) wrap. On an exterior beam, install two layers of unidirectional FRP wrap. Orient the first layer of the FRP wrap parallel to the centerline of the beam. Install this layer on the bottom of the beam flange. Orient the second layer of the FRP wrap perpendicular to the beam centerline. Wrap the second layer of FRP transversely around the bottom flange and outside web of the beam. Install the both layers of FRP a minimum of 12-in beyond the concrete patching in the longitudinal direction. Refer to BDM Figure 404-4 for the limits of the FRP in the longitudinal and transverse direction. Seal all repaired beam area with an epoxy-urethane sealer per C&amp;MS 512.03. On an interior beam, only the longitudinal layer is necessary. All other items apply.
The concrete patch and FRP wrap are not designed to strengthen beam. This application is only intended to provide corrosion protection for the reinforcement. Strengthening the beam with FRP will require a detail design based on the strengthening requirements of the repair.
The FRP repair may be completed with carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) or E-glass fiber reinforced polymer (EGFRP).

404.4.1.3 508BDAMAGED BEAM REPLACEMENT CRITERA
C404.4.1.3
Independent of the bridge rating, replace the beam when the following damaged is observed during the bridge survey.
Damage severe enough to warrant beam replacement is rare due to the relatively stiff beam section
A. Over 25% of the strands have been lost. A strand is considered lost when the effective strand section is reduced by over 25% (e.g. 2 or more of the 7-wire strand bundle is broken).
B. If the alignment of the girder has been permanently altered by the impact causing a bend point in the beam.
C. Severe concrete damage at girder ends resulting in permanent loss of prestressing in the strand.
404.4.2 348BHIGH SKEW STRUCTURE C404.4.2
Do not use box beams with a skew greater than 30-degrees.
When beam ends that are skewed greater than 30-degrees the asymmetric prestressing force becomes large enough to create a torque in the beams that can lift the beam off its bearings. Then the beam ends will rock when subjected to live load. Ultimately the rocking can cause the bearings to walk from underneath the beams.
When replacing the superstructure of an existing box beam bridge with a skew greater than 30-degrees the beams cannot be replaced in kind.
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025
4-60
A possible solution is to use box beams for a 30-degree skew and stagger them along the centerline of bearing. Bearing pads must be installed per BD-1-11 when the beams are being staggered. The anchored bearing secures the bearing from ever moving from below the beam. Refer to BDM Figure 404-5 for additional details. If utilizing this detail, it is important to obtain the accurate beam seat elevations during the survey of the existing structure. Minor adjustments to the beam seat may be required to account for the change in skew and how that if effected by the cross-slope. If grinding the seat is necessary, keep removal limits to 1/2-in or less.
Figure 404-5
404.4.3 349BCOMPOSITE DECK REPAIR C404.4.3
Do not replace composite decks on box beam structures. When the composite deck of an adjacent box beam structure needs repaired, the preferred method of repair would be an overlay. Refer to BDM Section 403.4 for additional information.
Complete removal of the composite deck without significantly damaging the top flange of the box beams is unlikely.
When overlaying the existing composite deck is not a viable solution, a complete superstructure replacement should be investigated.
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025

404.5 140BREINFORCED CONCRETE SLAB BRIDGES
C404.5
For single span slab bridges where stage construction is used, screen all bridges to determine whether the main reinforcement is parallel to the centerline of the roadway or is perpendicular to the abutment.
Early standard drawings called for the main reinforcement to be placed perpendicular to the abutments when the skew angle became larger than a certain value. This angle was revised over the years as new standard drawings were introduced.
Concrete slab bridges should be screened according to the following criteria:
A. Prior to 1931 the slab bridge standard drawing required the main reinforcement to be placed perpendicular to the abutments when the skew angle was equal to or greater than 20-degrees. This angle was revised to 25-degrees in 1931, 30-degrees in 1933 and finally 35-degrees in 1946. The standard drawing in 1973 required the main reinforcement to be parallel with the centerline of roadway regardless of the skew angle.
B. If the skew angle of the bridge is equal to or greater than the angles listed above for the year built, a temporary longitudinal bent will have to be designed to support the slab where it is cut. For example, a bridge built in 1938 with a 25-degree skew does not require a bent, however a bridge built in 1928 with a 25-degree skew does require a bent to be designed.
C. The deck should be inspected in the field to make a visual verification of the direction of the concrete reinforcement.
404.6 141BSEMI-INTEGRAL ABUTMENT CONVERSIONS
C404.6
For substructure semi-integral conversion details refer to BDM Section 405.7.
When the superstructure and/or deck is being replaced, converting of an existing jointed structure to semi-integral should be considered.
Converting to a semi-integral structure is encouraged where possible due to the decreased maintenance relative to a jointed structure.
The detail presented in BDM Figure 404-6 may be used to alleviate the lateral earth pressure induced into the superstructure. By utilizing these details, semi-integral conversions can be achieved on structures with a fix pier and curved or dog-legged beams/girders.
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025
4-62
If these details are used a fixed bearing is required for bridge stability. Design an expansion device to be installed at the end of the approach slab. Design and install the expansion device in accordance with standard drawing AS-2-15.
Figure 404-6 404.6.1 350BSTRUCTURAL STEEL
Prior to encasing the beam ends prepare the ends per SSPC SP11 and paint beam ends with non-organic zinc prime coat per C&amp;MS 514. Extend the limits of the beam preparation and painting 1-ft beyond the limits of the end diaphragm concrete.
After the diaphragm concrete is set, seal the interface between the beam and the concrete with caulk.
404.6.1.1 509BINADEQUATE BEARING CLEARANCE
C404.6.1.1
The beam end may be coped when the clearance between the beam seat and the bottom of the flange is not sufficient to install the semi-integral bearing device. For additional details on the beam coping refer to BDM Figure 404-7. It is the responsibility of the engineer to ensure the coped beam end has sufficient capacity to carry the required loads.
This detail should only be used as an attempt to avoid performing modifications to the beam seat. Modifications to beam seat can be expensive and labor intensive. There is also a concern that the seat reinforcing will be damaged during the installation of the dowels. If seat modifications are inevitable the beam shall not be coped.
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025
4-63
The modification to the existing beam and the components of the coping detail shall be designed by an engineer. Specify the bearing assembly to be either metalized, galvanized per C&amp;MS 711.02, or prime coated per C&amp;MS 514.

405 24BSUBSTRUCTURE
405.1 142BSUBSTRUCTURE CONDITION SURVEY
C405.1
Provide a Substructure Condition Survey for every bridge rehabilitation project. Prepare the survey as near as practicable to the plan preparation stage and before beginning detail design work for the rehabilitation. The survey shall include the following information for each substructure unit on the project:
The purpose of the Substructure Condition Survey is to identify and estimate deterioration effects.  Focus areas are locations exposed to de-icing chemicals from roadway drainage or concrete disintegration where exposed in splash zones or stream flows.
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025
4-64
These surveys are critical in determining the condition of the substructure and whether or not it is economical to reuse. The survey provides documentation of the location and type of distress in the substructure and should be detailed similar to the deck surveys.  The surveys will be used later to develop detailed repair plans, if applicable.
A. All bridge inventory information
B. Most recent bridge inspection findings C. Age and history of existing rehabilitation work on
the substructure units D. Dates and results of all evaluation techniques
performed on the substructure units
E. Sketches of the substructure units dimensioning: locations of unsound areas; delamination; cracking/crack density; spalling; patching; discoloration, efflorescence and moisture staining; section loss; and all testing/sampling locations
Extra care for should be taken for pile bents, these are the simplest and least expensive piers to construct. This pier type consists of driven piles (H-pile, circular pile, or fluted mono-tubes) with a concrete cap beam cast over the top of the piles to support the superstructure. Steel piling should be checked immediately below the splash zone, water line, and mud lines for deterioration and possible loss of section. High section loss is common these areas due to corrosion from bacterial attack at 3-ft to 6-ft below the water line or mud lines.
F. Photos and descriptions of all substructure units
G. Photos and descriptions of all cores and core holes (if applicable)
Abutment and pier concrete reuse may require core tests to determine the quality and strength of the concrete.
H. Estimate of the total substructure area deemed unsound
I. Scour assessment (if applicable) Footings and pilings exposed due to erosion and undermining shall be assessed for loss of bearing capacity and/or section.
J. Load Rating results for each substructure unit (if required by the Scope of Services)
If elements of the substructure are thought to have sufficient damage that significantly affects the load capacity then a Load Rating should be made.
K. Recommendations for substructure rehabilitation treatments and estimated service life.
All exposed piling shall be encased during the rehabilitation project.
Substructures units with greater than 40% of the element in a condition state of 3 and 4 are candidates for replacement. Upon completion of the rehabilitation work, no portion of a main element should be below a condition state 2.
L. Temporary shoring requirements (if necessary)

Evaluate all substructure units scheduled for rehabilitation according to BDM Section 303.1.4.
405.1.3 353BCORING C405.1.3
If required by Scope of Service, core substructure units concrete according to ASTM C42.
Coring is a destructive technique that provides samples for strength, permeability and chloride concentration testing whose results can indicate extent of deterioration. More importantly, this technique also provides visual evidence of the integrity of the substructure unit.
Take a minimum of two (2) cores per substructure unit.
Take at least one core from an apparently sound area to compare with core(s) taken from questionable areas. Take cores in suspicious areas to verify and further define areas of unsoundness.
Cores should be taken when:
A. Original plan or material information is not available.
B. Determining type of repair material.
C. Aid in determining integrity of concrete D. Multiple materials have been used.
Repair core holes using an ODOT approved non-shrink mortar, C&amp;MS 705.22, installed according to the manufacturer’s recommended specifications. Seal repair with HMWM according to C&amp;MS 512.04.
Inspect the cores for: obvious crumbling; stratification or delamination zones; soundness of aggregate; and depth and condition of concrete reinforcement.
If required by the Scope of Services, test core samples for compressive strength according to ASTM C39 and for permeability according to ASTM C1202.
Provide the location of all cores taken. Provide a description of the cores and all test results.
405.1.4 354BCHLORIDE CONCENTRATION TESTING
C405.1.4
When specified in the Scope of Services, analyze the chloride ion content of all cores according to ASTM C1218.
The purpose of chloride concentration testing is to determine the extent of chloride ingress into the concrete surface. Corrosion of the reinforcement due to chloride ingress is a primary cause of damage to reinforced concrete structures. Corrosion typically exists when the chloride ion content exceeds 2-lb/yd3 [500 ppm].
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025

For projects with no coring requirements specified, drill 1-in diameter holes in the substructure to a maximum depth of 2-in, or as specified in the Scope of Services, with a rotary impact drill. Collect powdered concrete samples at every 0.5-in of hole depth. After collecting each sample, thoroughly clean hole with compressed air before proceeding to avoid contaminating future sample collection. Label all sample containers by location and sample depth. Analyze the chloride ion content of all collected samples according to ASTM C1218. Repair all holes according to BDM Section 403.1.2. Determine the number of drill holes using the coring requirements of BDM Section 403.1.2.
Prepare a report of all test results. Include a sketch that identifies all hole locations and chloride ion concentrations.
405.2 143BCONCRETE REPAIR C405.2
Most bridge substructure rehabilitations will require some type of concrete repair. The following sections provides some conventional guidance when to use the several patching options listed in the Departments specifications.
Clearly denote areas of concrete removal on the plans. No corners of the saw cut perimeter shall be less than 90-degrees.
Provide minimum lap splices for replacement reinforcement to existing reinforcement or provide mechanical splices according to C&amp;MS 509.07.
The material and coating of the replacement concrete reinforcement shall match the existing reinforcement’s coating.
When replacement concrete reinforcement is anticipated, provide the following pay item: ITEM 509 – CONCRETE REINFORCEMENT, REPLACEMENT OF EXISTING CONCRETE REINFORCEMENT, AS PER PLAN. Provide a plane note to specify reinforcement to be replaced in-kind.
Replacement reinforcement is required for steel damaged during concrete removal or deteriorated steel with 10% or more cross-section reduction. For an estimated quantity for replacement steel, use 5-10% of the existing steel in the repair area.
405.2.1 355BCONCRETE PATCHING WITH FORMWORK
C405.2.1
Repair concrete reinforced with uncoated steel reinforcement according to SS844. Repair concrete reinforced with epoxy coated steel reinforcement according to C&amp;MS 519 or SS844.
The form-and-pour method is the primary method selected to repair existing substructures. The repair should incorporate materials and methods that are compatible with the existing materials, character, and purpose.
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025
4-67
This work often requires additional information not covered by the C&amp;MS. For example, the Designer should specify limitations for concrete form anchorage placement, and permissible access locations for concrete placement.
Provide a plan note that clearly defines the maximum removal limits for the concrete members under repair.
The Designer should consider the structural effects of concrete removal extending beyond the limits anticipated and shown in the plans. The purpose should be to prevent an overstress/unstable condition that would require a change order for the addition of temporary support after the contract sale. Example conditions include: excess concrete removals which reduce development and lap splice lengths; and excess compression zone removals causing an unbalanced strain condition.
Designers should consider maximum removal limits at least 25% larger in every direction than the limits shown in the plans for determining structural effects. For projects where removal up to and including the maximum removal limits produce structural deficiencies, provide a pay item for temporary support and include the support locations and support loads in the plans.
Blister concrete repair areas shall meet the minimum concrete cover requirements specified in BDM Section 304.4.10.
<em>For areas where the existing cover to the concrete reinforcement will not permit the minimum spacing for concrete consolidation (LRFD 5.10.3.1) between the bars and the form, provide additional cover by extending the surface beyond the original concrete surface with a blister.</em>
405.2.2 356BTROWELABLE MORTAR C405.2.2
Repair concrete according to SS843, Patching Concrete Structures with Trowelable Mortar.
Show the areas to be repaired with Trowelable Mortar in the plans.
Trowelable mortar should generally be specified when the repair depth is less than 1.5-in deep, and the repair area is less than 150-ft2. Trowelable mortar should also be specified in lieu of pneumatically placed mortar for the case where the depth of patch is equal to or less than 3-in and the quantity is less than 150-ft2. The maximum depth of patch that should be attempted with this type of mortar is 3-in.
Trowelable mortar is typically specified for overhead and vertical surfaces of substructures. These hand-applied repair mortars are generally recommended for repairs cosmetic in nature.
Generally, placement thickness should be less than 2-3/4-in on vertical surfaces, and 2-in on overhead surfaces. While, deeper placements can be made, this will require additional time and multiple lifts according to most manufacturer recommendations.
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025
4-68
Overhead spalls less than 1-in in depth are not candidates for trowelable mortar unless plan notes are provided to indicate removal depths greater than 1-in.
405.3 144BPNEUMATICALLY PLACED CONCRETE - SHOTCRETE
C405.3
Repair concrete according to ITEM 520 –  PNEUMATICALLY PLACED CONCRETE - SHOTCRETE.
Seal shotcrete repair areas according to C&amp;MS 512. Provide a plan note to not apply sealers to shotcrete material for a minimum of 28 days after placement.
Shotcrete is used in lieu of conventional concrete patching C&amp;MS ITEM 519 – PATCHING CONCRETE STRUCTURES, in most instances for reasons of cost or convenience. Shotcrete is advantageous in situations when formwork is cost prohibitive or impractical. Shotcrete operations can often be accomplished in areas of limited access to make repairs to structures and is a good option for large areas (i.e. ≥ 150-ft2) of vertical and overhead patching.
The minimum compressive strength of shotcrete specified in C&amp;MS 520 is 2000-psi at 3-days and 4000-psi at 28-days. For applications where a higher strength is warranted, the Item will need to be “As Per Plan” with notes defining the minimum compressive strength requirements as well as adjusted compressive strength pay factors defined in C&amp;MS Table 520.16-1.
405.4 145BCATHODIC PROTECTION C405.4
Use embedded or surface applied galvanic anodes or distributed galvanic anode systems according to SS844 where uncoated steel reinforcement is to be utilized with the following:
SS844 uses a passive galvanic cathodic method of protection. The passive galvanic cathodic is based upon the principles of dissimilar metal corrosion and the relative position of specific metals in the galvanic series. Galvanic anodes consist of pure zinc encapsulated within a compressible material or an alkali-activated cementitious shell.  The anodes are used to extend the life of standard concrete repairs by protecting reinforcement that remains in chloride-contaminated concrete around the concrete repairs where future corrosion can occur. SS844 specify two types of galvanic cathodic protection:
A discrete galvanic anode with a single point wire connection. (Examples are patching repairs anodes, AKA the Hockey puck. Drill-in plug-type for sound areas of concrete areas).
A distributed galvanic anode system is a long strip anode with a multiple wire connection to the reinforcing grid and distributed over the surface of a concrete structure. The system may be either embedded or surfaced applied.
Galvanic anodes are not effective with the following:
i. Patch material with electrical resistivity greater than 50,000 ohm-cm. This many include polymer, fly ash, latex modified, and silica fume-based repair materials.
A. Substructure patching
B. Substructure repairs, where new concrete is placed next to existing concrete.
C. Substructure widening, where new concrete placed next to existing concrete.
D. Adding corrosion control in aggressive environments to a repair project.
Consideration should be given to concrete repairs where the epoxy coating on reinforcing steel has been compromised, by corrosion or mechanical means.
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025
4-69
ii. Additional steps are necessary if the rebars are epoxy coated.
iii. Low Volume Shotcrete: Repairs performed by low volume shotcrete using Dry-Pak-It methodology..
In the plans, show the number of anodes, spacing requirements, minimum zinc requirement.
Include BDM Detail Note [702.17-1] in the plans.
Refer to SS844 for additional design information.
Provide details showing an electrical connection between both top and bottom mat of bridge deck reinforcing steel.
Discrete and distributed galvanic anodes are normally intended to provide corrosion protection both top and bottom mat of reinforcing steel.
Place anodes along the perimeter of concrete patches or along the interface between new/existing concrete to mitigate the formation of new corrosion sites in the existing concrete.
Corrosion control used for generally sound concrete with high corrosion risk Environment (Steel Potential greater than -350 mV) use either Drill-in plug-type anodes can be placed into drilled holes on a grid pattern in sound concrete to provide distributed protection or surface applied system with electrical leads. Corrosion control of pre-stressed/post-tensioned concrete structures provide an electrical connection between the wire strands and the anodes.
Determine the discrete galvanic anode spacing by the reinforcing steel density ratio. This ratio is equal to the perimeter of the rebar divided by the spacing of that rebar per 12 in2 of concrete patch.
The use of galvanic anode or Distributed Anode Systems (DAS) requires the use of hydraulic cement-based material with an electrical resistivity less than 50,000 ohm-cm.
405.5 146BSUBSTRUCTURE REHABILITATION
C405.5
The important first step of repairing damaged or deteriorated concrete is to correctly determine the cause of damage. Knowing what caused the damage, and reducing or eliminating that cause, will make the repair last longer. If no attempt is made to eliminate the original cause of damage, the repair may fail as the original concrete did, resulting in wasted effort and investment.
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025
4-70
405.6 147BABUTMENT REHABILITATION C405.6
Repair concrete per BDM Section 405.2. There are several strategies for abutment rehabilitation. These strategies are focused around safety, capacity, functionality, operational need, life cycle, and financial constraints at the time of rehabilitation. The amount of analysis needed to determine the appropriate rehabilitation will vary.
Consider the following guidelines for substructure rehabilitation.
A. After rehabilitation, an abutment may be assumed to have the same life cycle as the rehabilitated superstructure.
B. Address scour problems or other hydraulics issues. C. Perform complete removal and replacement of
deteriorated bridge seats beneath and adjacent to the bearings in lieu of remedial patching.
D. Consider modifying beam seats by placing new concrete in front of the breastwall.
405.7 148BSEMI-INTEGRAL CONVERSIONS C405.7
On projects, where the deck is being replaced, consideration shall be giving to eliminating the expansion joints and converting to a semi-integral superstructure. Bridges without joints provide better protection from water and salt damage to the superstructure and substructure.
The Department will not permit the use of semi-integral abutments founded on a single row of piles.
Because the superstructure is not mechanically attached to the foundation, the abutment foundation shall be stable. Abutments on a single row of piling will deflect which can cause damage to bearings or possibly even a loss of bearing.
Spread footings supported on soil may be considered for semi-integral conversions provided the analysis of all applied loadings do not cause a settlement, bearing capacity or sliding problem for the foundation.
Abutments founded on two or more rows of piling, drilled shafts and spread footings on rock do not require additional analysis in order to convert to semi-integral.
The semi-integral design is appropriate for a total unfactored expansion/contraction movement of 3-in or less.
This movement equates to approximately a 250-ft expansion length for steel assuming a temperature range of 150°F and coefficient of thermal expansion of 6.5x10-6/°F or a 500-ft expansion length for concrete assuming a temperature range of 80°F and coefficient of thermal expansion of 6.0x10-6/°F.
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025
4-71
Detail the geometry and layout of the approach slab, wingwalls, curbs, sidewalks, utilities and transition concrete bridge railing to permit the anticipated longitudinal movement of the superstructure.
Wingwalls details shall accommodate the relative movement of between the walls and the approach slab since the superstructure and approach slab move together. If the approach slab were connected to turned back wings in any manner, then movement of the entire superstructure would be restricted. Also refer to BDM Section 306.2.2.6 for further discussion.
For bridges with skews, design the rehabilitated substructures for the forces caused by superstructure expansion/contraction. Refer to BDM Section 306.2.2.6 for more information. These forces could be transferred with Diaphragm Guides, wingwalls or guided bearings. Installing new Diaphragm Guides and guided bearings may be difficult because of the primary steel in the bearing seats and should therefore be considered when bearing seats are also being replaced. These forces may also be too large for a typical turned back wingwall to resist.
Do not place the proposed approach slab on top of turnback wingwalls. There shall be a minimum on 6-in, measured vertically, between the removal limits of the turnback wingwall and the bottom of the proposed approach slab.
This will likely lead to the turnback wingwalls needing to be widened from their original position. Doweling into the existing wingwall and footing is often an effective method for constructing the proposed wingwalls.
Do not install the bridge and/or approach railing on top of turnback wingwalls. Locate the railing on top of the approach slab.
405.8 149BPIER REHABILITATION C405.8
Repair concrete according to BDM Section 405.2.
Seal all surfaces of piers adjacent to roadways as described in BDM Section 306.1.2 with epoxy-urethane or non-epoxy sealer according to C&amp;MS 512.
Protect pier supports added to widened substructures according to BDM Section 1003.10 S3.6.5.1.
The Department will consider single column and two column substructure units that support more than one primary superstructure member as non-redundant unless otherwise supported by a structural analysis. The Department will consider single column substructure units that support non-redundant superstructure members as non-redundant. Connecting a non-redundant type of substructure unit into an adjacent unit may eliminate a redundancy issue and prevent the need to provide additional pier protection.
Designers should investigate the cost and feasibility of connecting all single column substructure units into adjacent units. Even though single column substructure units that support one primary redundant superstructure member may be assumed as redundant, connecting the single column into an adjacent substructure unit will provide additional resistance to loss in the event of a vehicle collision regardless of the pier protection required.
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025

Provide sufficient details and plan notes to clearly identify the limits and methods of the proposed repairs on the plans
405.9 150BPIER CAP STRENGTHENING C405.9
The shear capacity of existing reinforced concrete pier caps may be a common item contributing to an inventory level rating factor less than 1.00 for the Design Loading defined in BDM Section 401.3.
<em>The most common method of analysis for concrete pier caps is the Sectional Method (LRFD 5.7.3) which may produce overly-conservative results for deep members. Alternatively, the Strut-and-Tie Method (LRFD 5.8.2) yields more accurate results; however, the STM analysis requires more effort and experience than the Sectional Method. Fortunately, a tool, STM-CAP.xlsm, is now available to simplify STM modeling of pier caps. More information regarding the use of this tool, as well as design examples, are available in the final report, Evaluation of Reserve Shear Capacity of Bridge Pier Caps Using the Deep Beam Theory.</em>
Refer to BDM Section 401.4 for more information related to Design Exception requirements and considerations.
Regardless of the method used to increase the structural capacity of a pier cap, perform an analysis and detail the rehabilitation to represent the correct sequence of load application.
For example, if the existing pier cap is not jacked and supported to remove dead load, then the strengthening methodology will not contribute to the dead load carrying capacity of the member.
Provide a Composite Fiber Wrap System in accordance with PN519. Clearly dimension the FRP locations in the plans and specify the factored capacity increase (in Kips) required for each location identified. Include pay items for the work necessary to restore damaged and/or unsound concrete substrate deeper than 0.5-in and larger than 4-in2. Provide a pay item for epoxy injection when cracks in the existing substrate are greater than 10 mils (0.010-in).
Designate each appurtenance attached to existing members to be wrapped to be removed and reinstalled. The Department will pay for this work separately from the Composite Fiber Wrap System.
The Department considers the use of externally applied composite FRP as the most feasible and economical method to address strengthening of pier caps in good condition. PN519 does not include work to repair concrete surfaces. This work needs to be paid for under separate pay items.
Other methods to consider for strengthening pier caps experiencing varying degrees of deterioration include externally applied post-tensioning and normally reinforced concrete encasement. In both cases, all steel shall be encased in concrete with adequate cover and sufficient room to permit the flow of concrete and aggregate.
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025
4-73
405.10 151BPIER COLUMN WRAPPING C405.10
Provide a Composite Fiber Wrap System in accordance with PN519. Clearly dimension the FRP locations in the plans and specify the factored capacity increase (in Kips) or confining stress required for each location identified.
Include pay items for the work necessary to restore damaged and/or unsound concrete substrate deeper than 0.5-in and larger than 4-in2. Provide a pay item for epoxy injection when cracks in the existing substrate are greater than 10 mils (0.010-in).
Designate appurtenances attached to existing members receiving FRP to be removed and reinstalled. The Department will pay for this work separately from the Composite Fiber Wrap System.
When 15% or more of the surface area contains corroded steel reinforcement, provide a layer of concrete encasement to be placed around it. To add a concrete encasement:
A. Place anchor bars in existing solid concrete using expansion anchors or epoxy anchors.
B. Place horizontal and vertical reinforcement or welded wire reinforcement in the encasement.
C. Place forms and pour concrete with no less than a 6-in thickness.
D. Provide FRP
405.11 152BFOUNDATIONS C405.11
The Department will allow the reuse of bridge foundations for rehabilitation projects provided each of the following items are met:
A. There are no scour issues. B. The foundations are structurally sound. C. The foundations are not exhibiting settlement or
rotational issues.
D. Foundations are not timber. If conditions A through D are met, and if the Service Limit State loading has not increased by greater than 10% compared to the original unfactored design loading, the foundations may be reused without any evaluation of their geotechnical resistance.
Reusing existing bridge foundations can save considerable costs and shorten delivery times significantly.
The determination of structural soundness requires consideration of section loss due to corrosion. Refer to BDM Section 405.11.1 for more information on corrosion rates.
405.11.1 357BEXISTING PILE C405.11.1
When the Scope of Services for a rehabilitation project requires an assessment of the existing foundation, evaluate both the structural and geotechnical resistance of existing piling to be reused.
To determine the factored structural resistance for existing steel piling, utilize a corrosion rate of 0.47-mils/yr (0.00047-in/yr) for piles buried in non-aggressive natural soils, and a total service life equal to the current age plus an additional 75-yr service life. If the evaluation of the site conditions indicates a potential pile deterioration or corrosion problem, determine the appropriate corrosion loss rate for carbon steel per Eurocode 3, Part 5, Section 4.4 for the environmental conditions at the site.
Steel piling should be inspected immediately below the splash zone or water line for deterioration and possible loss of section. High section loss has occurred in some areas due to corrosion from bacterial attack at 3-ft to 6-ft below the water line. Calculated structural resistance of existing piling and pile caps shall account for measured and estimated section loss.
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025
4-74
Provide pile encasement for exposed steel piling for bridges over waterways. The pile encasement shall extend a minimum of 3-ft below the ground line/stream bottom.
A form of pile encasement for new bridges is detailed on Standard Bridge Drawing CPP-1-08. For existing bridges, the polyethylene pipe may be cut and half and held in place after installation with steel straps. The top of the encasement shall be located no more than 1-ft from the bottom of the pile cap and the concrete fill shall be sloped to drain.
Alternatively, the exposed piling can be coated in accordance with ITEM 514 – PAINTING OF STRUCTURAL STEEL or SS845 – SHOP AND FIELD METALLIZING OF STRUCTURAL STEEL.
405.11.2 358BDRIVEN PILES C405.11.2
When the Scope of Services requires an evaluation of existing driven pile foundations for a rehabilitation project, perform analysis of both the structural and geotechnical resistance in accordance with BDM Section 305.3.
Determine the geotechnical resistance of existing piling to be reused in a rehabilitation project using the following criteria:
A. For driven pile foundations where the dynamic load testing records can be found and reviewed, determine the geotechnical resistance using a resistance factor equal to 0.70 applied to the measured nominal end of initial driving (EOID) resistance or the Restrike resistance, whichever was measured last. If more than one pile in the foundation unit was tested, use the value for the pile with the lowest measured resistance.
This requirement assumes dynamic test results (EOID or Restrike) are available and provide the minimum driven pile nominal resistance.
B. For driven pile foundations where no dynamic test results are available for (A) above, but pile driving logs are available from the installation of the existing piling, determine the geotechnical resistance using the WSDOT Pile Driving Formula and a dynamic resistance factor of 0.55.
This requirement assumes pile driving logs are available from the installation of the existing piling. The WSDOT Pile Driving Formula is discussed in publication WA-RD 610.1, &#34;Development of the WSDOT Pile Driving Formula and Its Calibration for Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD)&#34; (Allen, 2005).
C. For foundations where: (1) the minimum driven pile resistance is unknown for (A) above and (2) pile driving logs are not available for (B) above, determine the geotechnical resistance using the pile resistance (minimum bearing capacity) from the original plans. For plans produced prior to LRFD, this value is allowable; multiply by a factor of 2 to determine the nominal geotechnical resistance, and then apply a resistance factor of 0.55 for the factored geotechnical resistance.
This requirement assumes the original plans are available and provide the pile resistance (minimum bearing capacity). The length of the existing pile need not be known, nor do boring logs or the soil profile need to be available.
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025
4-75
D. For foundations where (A), (B) and (C) above do not apply, but the installed pile dimensions are definitively known, determine the geotechnical resistance using static analysis and appropriate resistance factors from BDM Table 305-1.
This requirement assumes the length of existing pile is known and boring logs are available. If the length of the existing pile is unknown, non-destructive test methods can be performed on the existing piling to determine their length. If boring logs are not available, a new subsurface investigation will be necessary to generate new boring logs.
If none of the above are applicable, the piles may not be considered for re-use.
405.11.3 359BMICROPILES C405.11.3
Do not reuse existing micropile foundations. New micropiles may be used to supplement other existing foundations for increased resistance.
Micropiles can withstand axial and/or lateral loads and may be considered a substitute for conventional piles or as one component in a composite soil/pile mass, depending upon the design concept employed. Micropiles are installed by methods that cause minimal disturbance to adjacent structures, soil, and the environment. They can be installed in access- restrictive environments and in all soil types and ground conditions. Micropiles can be installed at angles using the same type of equipment used for ground anchor and grouting projects.
405.11.4 360BSPREAD FOOTINGS C405.11.4
Do not modify the footprint for an existing spread footing founded on soil. If it is necessary to widen or increase loading for a structure supported on a spread footing, supplement the spread footing with deep foundation elements.
The foundation soil beneath a new extension of a spread footing will consolidate under the increased loading. This consolidation will lead to settlement, rotation, or structural damage.
Any increase in dead loading to a spread footing founded on soil will result in additional settlement and the potential to exceed bearing resistance. Include these effects in the analysis and design of the existing or replacement superstructure.
Refer to BDM Section C405.7 when considering spread footings for semi-integral abutments.
405.11.5 361BDRILLED SHAFTS C405.11.5
When the Scope of Services requires an evaluation of existing drilled shaft foundations for a rehabilitation project, perform analysis of both the structural and geotechnical resistance in accordance with BDM Section 305.4.
Drilled shafts socketed into bedrock will typically provide sufficient capacity for reuse; however, friction drilled shafts may present a capacity issue if the loading on the existing shafts increases.
405.12 153BWIDENING C405.12
Refer to BDM Section 406.1 for information regarding the use of anchors and dowels.
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025
4-76
405.12.1 362BABUTMENT WIDENING C405.12.1
Make abutments and footings continuous by splicing new reinforcement to either:
A. Dowels anchored into the existing substructure.  B. The existing substructure’s reinforcement exposed
by concrete removal operations.
It is typically much more cost effective to detail splices using dowels than by removing concrete and splicing onto the existing reinforcement. Refer to BDM Section 405.12 for restrictions on anchor dowels.
Seal abutment surfaces according to BDM Section 303.1.
405.12.2 363BPIER WIDENING C405.12.2
Provide separate caps for widenings requiring three or more columns.
Consider connecting new caps for multi-columned piers, in which two or less columns are required, to the existing caps and avoid non-redundant members.
For bridge widening projects, the pier cap may be widened and cantilevered off the existing stem. Refer to BDM Section 405.12 for restrictions on anchor dowels.
Refer to BDM Section C405.8 for more information on pier protection for non-redundant members.
405.12.3 364BFOUNDATION WIDENING C405.12.3
Support widened foundations on piles, drilled shafts or spread footings on rock to limit differential settlement.
Consider differential foundation settlements. For example, if it is required to widen a bridge adjacent to an existing spread footing, it is possible that the existing foundation has settled as much as it is going to. However, if the widened portion is placed on a new spread footing, then that portion will settle with respect to the original and distress to the structure will result.
405.13 154BMECHANICALLY STABILIZED EARTH (MSE) WALLS
Refer to Design Data Sheet, MSEWR-1-18 for repairs to MSE walls -MSE Wall Repairs located on the OSE website.
405.14 155BSUBSTRUCTURE DRAINAGE C405.14
Retrofit all dysfunctional drainage systems. Provide replacement drainage according to BDM Sections 200 and 300.
Damage often occurs to existing bridges as a result of poorly designed drainage. Proper drainage is extremely important to the longevity of the structure.
Perform pavement drainage calculations according to the L&amp;D, Vol. 2. If the calculations indicate that the existing scuppers are not necessary, and the deck is not to be replaced, permanently plug the existing scuppers and collect the additional drainage at the end of the bridge. If the deck is to be replaced, remove the scuppers and grind all scupper weld locations smooth.
BDM Section 400 –Rehabilitation and Maintenance 2020 Edition – January 2025
4-77
For existing scuppers to remain, extend the length so that the termination is at least 8-in below the bottom of the bottom flange. Remove and repair or completely replace existing scuppers with extensive section loss due to corrosion.
405.15 156B RIDGE SCOUR
For all bridges over waterways to be rehabilitated, perform a Scour Assessment.
The Owner may want to perform a Scour Assessment for projects not meeting BDM Section 405.15.3.B prior to finalizing the Scope of Services. If this work is included in the Scope of Services for the Design Agency to perform, there is the potential for scope creep to occur.
An assessment checklist is available in Appendix I of the ODOT Manual of Bridge Inspection.
405.15.1 365BSCOUR DEFINITIONS
Check Flood – Scour event as defined by the scour check flood frequency specified in L&amp;D Volume 2 Section 1008.10.1. Scour associated with this event indicates the maximum amount of foundation material removed to allow the structure to remain in service.
Design Flood – Scour event as defined by the scour design flood frequency specified in L&amp;D Volume 2 Section 1008.10.1. Scour associated with this event is the maximum amount of foundation material removed that does not affect the load carrying ability of the structure.
Observed Scour –  A void in foundation material beneath or adjacent to a structure, resulting from the scouring action of a waterway, and documented during a Scour Assessment.
Scour – The removal of foundation material beneath or adjacent to a structure resulting from the scouring action of a waterway.
Scour Analysis – The process required to determine an estimated depth of scour for the design and check flood events. This process includes geotechnical exploration, topographic and hydrographic survey, hydraulic modelling, and scour computations.
Scour Assessment – An activity performed by competent individuals to identify, locate, measure and document   Observed Scour by inspecting existing conditions and comparing to past conditions. An assessment checklist is available in Appendix I of the ODOT Manual of Bridge Inspection.
Scour Countermeasures – Material, devices, or structures designed to prevent, slow, or stop the occurrence of scour.
Scour Critical – A bridge condition that indicates structural instability is possible due to any future scouring action of a waterway. This condition can be illustrated by analysis when Observed Scour produces a foundation capacity-to-demand ratio less than 1.0. This condition also exists when the foundation for a bridge over or adjacent to a waterway is unknown.
Scour Evaluation – An interdisciplinary team approach involving hydraulic, structural, and geotechnical expertise to determine the scour vulnerability of an existing or proposed structure over a waterway. A Scour Evaluation includes a Scour Assessment, Scour Analysis and resulting  structural evaluation.

REHABILITATION TOPICS
406.1 157BADHESIVE ANCHOR/DOWEL DESIGN
Do not specify an adhesive anchor/dowel system for the following applications:
A. Deck edge replacement for non-slab bridges The preferred repair would be to reuse the existing transverse deck steel in the deck edge replacement. The deck edge for some slab bridge may be able to be designed using dowels.
B. Replacing a concrete railing on an existing deck The preferred repair would be to rebuild the deck edge and build the railing per the applicable standard.
C. Retrofitting an abutment with a diaphragm guide. The preferred repair would be to remove the existing abutment concrete with a jack hammer while leaving the existing reinforcing and placing the diaphragm reinforcement around the existing reinforcement. Since SICD-2-14 utilizes a closed loop, solutions that use 2 U-shape bars or headed rebar may help with placing the new reinforcing around the existing reinforcing steel.
<em>Design adhesive anchor/dowel systems in accordance to AASHTO LRFD 5.13.</em>
Specify an adhesive anchor/dowel system when the anchor/dowel is subjected to a constant tension force or the factored tension load on the anchor/dowel is 15% or greater of the anchor/dowel’s factored tensile capacity.
For example, if the factored tensile strength of 5/8 -in anchor is 10-kips and the anticipated ultimate tensile load on the anchor is equal to or greater than 1.5 kips, design the anchor using an adhesive anchor system.
Use an adhesive anchor/dowel system when the anchor/dowel is subjected to a factored shear load on the anchor/dowel is 30% or greater of the anchor/dowel’s factored shear capacity.
When performing a backwall replacement on a jointed structure, design the dowels as an adhesive dowel system when the height of the wall exceeds 5’-0”. The height of the wall is measured from the top of the beam seat to the top of the wall. This dimension is variable across the width of the abutment, utilize the average height of the wall when determining if the dowels for the wall need to be designed using an adhesive system.

601 DESIGN REFERENCES
601.1 GENERAL
This section contains various typical general notes.  The designer needs to assure that the typical notes are complete and apply to the specific project.   These notes may need to be revised or specific notes must be written to conform to the actual conditions that exist on each individual project.
601.2 STANDARD DRAWINGS AND SUPPLEMENTAL SPECIFICATIONS
The designer shall list all Standard Bridge Drawings and Supplemental Specifications that apply, giving date of approval or latest revision date, if revised.
The Designer shall also ensure the listed Standard Bridge Drawings and Supplemental Specifications are transferred to the project plans title sheet and match the information on the title sheet.
[601.2-1] REFER to the following Standard Bridge Drawing(s):  <em><strong>Dated (revised)</strong></em>_
_________Dated (revised) __________   _________Dated (revised) __________
and to the following Supplemental Specification(s):  _________Dated __________
_________Dated __________ 601.3 DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS
The designer shall include the following note specifying the design specifications used on the structure.  If the note is not correct, then the note should be revised with the correct criterion that describes the design specifications for the structure.
[601.3-1] DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS: This structure conforms to the Xth Edition* of the “LRFD Bridge Design Specifications” adopted by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, XXXX* and the ODOT Bridge Design Manual, 2020.
NOTE TO DESIGNER:
*Designer should fill-in current edition.
The use of note [601.3-1] stipulates the use of live load distribution and designs based on AASHTO specifications, assumptions and standard beam theory design.  For the vast majority of ODOT bridges this criterion is not only adequate but also advantageously conservative.  There are structure types which, due to either AASHTO’s own limitations or the type of structure, require specific live load distribution factors or other analysis methods other than classical beam theory to analyze the structure.  Some examples may include a highly skewed slab bridge, a curved steel girder bridge, cable stayed bridges, etc.  If the structure’s analysis required the use of 2D or 3D models including grillage, finite element, finite strip, classical plate solutions the following note should be added.
BDM Section 600 – Typical General Notes 2020 Edition – January 2025
6-2
[601.3-2] SPECIAL DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS: This bridge required the use of a   # (# two or three) dimensional model using the      ##      (## grillage, finite element, finite strip, classical plate theory, etc.) design method to analyze the structure. The computer program used for structural analysis was _______. The bridge components designed by this method and the live load distribution factors used were:
Dead Load Distribution: (The designer is to explain the assumptions used in how the dead load was applied and distributed)
Live Load Distribution Factors:
Exterior Members- ____ for wheel (or axle) load &amp; _____ for lane load moments.      - ____ for wheel (or axle) load &amp; _____ for lane load shears
Interior Members- _____ for wheel (or axle) load &amp; _____ for lane load moments.      - _____ for wheel (or axle) load &amp; _____ for lane load shears

6-26
Notify the Engineer at least 5 days before driving piles so that the Engineer can notify the District Geotechnical Engineer, the Office of Construction Administration, and the Office of Geotechnical Engineering.
Drive the first two piles in each substructure to the tip elevation specified for each substructure. Drive the third and fourth piles to 75% and 85% of the length of the first two piles. Perform dynamic load testing on all four piles while driving. After driving the four piles, cease all driving operations at the substructure for a minimum of 10 days. Include the waiting period as a separate activity in the progress schedule. After the waiting period, perform pile restrikes on all four piles (two restrike items). Perform a CAPWAP analysis on each pile tested for every dynamic load test and every restrike test.
Submit all test results to the Engineer. The Engineer will review the test results and establish driving criteria for the piling in the substructure with the assistance of the District Geotechnical Engineer, the Office of Construction Administration, and the Office of Geotechnical Engineering. Perform the driving criteria with pile setup for the first stage of bridge construction. Do not order piles for subsequent phases until after the driving criteria has been established with setup. The Department will adjust the furnished pile quantities based on the restrike test results.
If the dynamic load testing indicates a pile has achieved the required UBV above the tip elevation during the initial driving (before the waiting period), stop driving and notify the Engineer. If the restrike test results indicate that any of the four piles did not achieve the required UBV, drive the pile to the established driving criteria. The Department will pay for splicing of the piles beyond the estimated length provided in the plans under C&amp;MS 109.05 with a negotiated price per splice.

Provide the following note whenever piles are to be driven pre-construction with a site-specific evaluation of driving criteria through a test pile program.
[606.7-5] TEST PILE PROGRAM
The Ultimate Bearing Value (UBV) is (1) kips per pile for the (2) (3) piles. Part of the UBV will be achieved through pile/soil setup, which is a time dependent increase in resistance that occurs in some soils.
Notify the Engineer at least 5 days before driving piles so that the Engineer can notify the District Geotechnical Engineer, the Office of Construction Administration, and the Office of Geotechnical Engineering.
At each substructure, drive a test pile, identical to the production piles, and using the same production pile hammer, to a length equal to 125% of the estimated length. Perform continuous dynamic monitoring and testing of the test pile during driving from 50% to 125% of the estimated length. Perform two CAPWAP analyses on the test pile, one at 75% of the estimated length, and one at 125% of the estimated length. After driving the test pile, cease all driving operations at the substructure for 7 days. At the end of 7 days, perform a pile restrike on the test pile, with a CAPWAP analysis. Continue the waiting period to 45 days after the end of initial drive. At the end of the 45 days, perform a second pile restrike on the test pile, with a CAPWAP analysis.

6-27
Submit all test results to the Engineer. The Engineer will review the test results with the assistance of the District Geotechnical Engineer, the Office of Construction Administration, and the Office of Geotechnical Engineering. The Engineer will develop a profile of cumulative setup with depth. At each elevation along the pile, setup is defined as the difference between the side resistance calculated in the CAPWAP analyses for the end of initial drive and for each of the restrikes. Tip resistance shall be the most conservative result from the four CAPWAP analyses (for the initial drive at 75% and 125% of the estimated length, for the 7 day restrike, and for the 45 day restrike). From these analyses, the engineer will determine a depth at which the UBV was achieved at the 45 day restrike, and for that depth, will subtract the cumulative setup to establish a target end of initial drive resistance (EOID).
Drive the first two production piles in the substructure to the established target EOID. Perform dynamic load testing on both piles, with a CAPWAP analysis on one of the two piles. (If the test pile was driven within the foundation footprint and can be incorporated into the foundation as a production pile, then only one additional production pile need be dynamically tested with a CAPWAP analysis.) After driving the first two production piles, again cease all driving operations at the substructure for 7 days. At the end of 7 days, perform a pile restrike on the first production pile(s), with a CAPWAP analysis on the same pile that received a CAPWAP analysis at the end of initial drive. Include each of the above waiting periods as separate activities in the progress schedule.
The Engineer will compare the 7 day restrike and CAPWAP analysis results for the production pile and for the test pile and will compare the plots of cumulative setup with depth developed from each 7 day restrike and CAPWAP analysis.
If the production pile 7 day restrike demonstrates the same or greater resistance than the test pile 7 day restrike at the same tip elevation, then use the more conservative of the end of initial drive dynamic testing results – between the test pile and production pile – to establish driving criteria according to C&amp;MS 507.05 and 523.04 for the remaining production piles for the established target EOID. Drive all remaining production piles to these driving criteria.
If the production pile 7 day restrike demonstrates lesser resistance than the test pile 7 day restrike at the same tip elevation, then reduce the cumulative setup with depth plot from the test pile 45 day restrike by the same percentage that the production pile fell short of the test pile 7 day restrike cumulative setup. From this reduced plot, the engineer will determine a greater depth at which the UBV was achieved at the 45 day restrike. All production piles will be driven to this depth, including the production pile that demonstrated lesser resistance at the 7 day restrike. The Department will pay for splicing of the piles beyond the estimated length provided in the plans under C&amp;MS 109.05 with a negotiated price per splice.

702 SUPERSTRUCTURE DETAILS
702.1 STEEL BEAM DEFLECTION AND CAMBER
For steel beam or built-up girder bridges provide a table similar to BDM Table 702-1 on a structural steel detail sheet. Tabulation is required regardless of the amount of deflection and is required for all beams or girders, if the deflection is different.
Show the deflection and camber data as described in BDM Section 308.2.2.1.f. The table is to include bearing points, midspan points, splice points and additional points if necessary, at maximum 25-ft increments.  Unique geometry may require an even closer spacing.

702.2 STEEL NOTCH TOUGHNESS REQUIREMENT (CHARPY V-NOTCH)
CVN material is a requirement to help assure fracture toughness of primary material.  Designers using this note should understand not only why CVN is specified but what is a primary member. BDM Section 308.2.2.1.h helps with the definition of primary members and specially highlights that cross-frames of curved steel structures are also primary members, because they transmit forces necessary to provide equilibrium. Designers are reminded they must indicate specific pieces, members, shapes, etc. that are primary members.
Place the following note on a structural steel detail sheet for bridges having main load-carrying members that must meet minimum notch toughness requirements:
[702.2-1] CVN: Where a shape or plate is designated (CVN), furnish material that meets the minimum notch toughness requirements as specified in C&amp;MS 711.01.
702.3 HIGH STRENGTH BOLTS
For all structural steel superstructures, place the following note on the structural detail sheet:
[702.3-1] HIGH STRENGTH BOLTS shall be ___________ diameter A325 unless otherwise noted.

702.4.1 CONCRETE INTERMEDIATE DIAPHRAGM FOR PRESTRESSED CONCRETE I-BEAMS
If the design plans do not reference Standard Bridge Drawing PSID-1-13, provide the following note.
[702.4.1-1] INTERMEDIATE DIAPHRAGMS: Do not place the deck concrete until all intermediate diaphragms have been properly installed. If concrete diaphragms are used, complete the installation of the intermediate diaphragms at least 48 hours before deck placement begins. Concrete shall conform to C&amp;MS 511 with a design strength of 4.5 ksi.
702.4.2 SEMI-INTEGRAL OR INTEGRAL ABUTMENT CONCRETE PLACEMENT FOR
DIAPHRAGMS
Hardened concrete end diaphragms restrain the movement and rotation of beam/girder ends that occur during deck placement.  This restraint will increase stress in both the beam/girder and diaphragm.  Factors that can contribute to detrimental stress increases include large structure skew and phased construction.  When these factors exist, hardened diaphragms should be avoided during the deck placement. BDM Table 702-2 provides guidelines for concrete diaphragm placement options.

702.5 CONCRETE DECK SLAB DEPTH AND PAY QUANTITIES
For all steel beam and girder bridges with a concrete deck, provide the following note that describes how the quantity of deck concrete was calculated.
[702.5-1] DECK SLAB CONCRETE QUANTITY: The estimated quantity of deck slab concrete is based on the constant deck slab thickness, as shown, plus the quantity of concrete that forms each beam/girder haunch. The estimate assumes a constant haunch thickness of         inches and a haunch width equal to the top flange width. Deviate from this haunch thickness as necessary to place the deck surface at the finished grade.
The haunch thickness was measured at the centerline of the beam/girder, from the surface of the deck to the bottom of the top flange minus the deck slab thickness. The area of all embedded steel plates has been deducted from the haunch quantity in accordance with 511.23.
NOTE TO DESIGNER: The note above applies to both rolled beams and plate girders, and measures the haunch to the top of the web (bottom of top flange).  The note above applies to new structures with beams/girders placed parallel to the profile grade line.  A constant depth haunch may not be practical for new structures whose beams/girders are not placed parallel to the profile grade line.  In these special cases, the note shall be modified to fit the exact conditions.

[702.6-1] CAMBER:  Estimated camber at Day 0 (D0) is _____ inches.
Estimated camber at Day 30 (D30) is _____ inches.  Deflection due to remaining dead load (e.g. concrete deck, cross-frames, diaphragms, bridge
railing, utilities, etc.) is _____ inches.  The beam seat elevations assume estimated camber D30 with a sacrificial haunch thickness of 2-
inches.
NOTE TO DESIGNER: Refer to BDM Section 308.2.3.4.b for description of camber values. If the sacrificial haunch depth differs from 2-inches, revise the note accordingly. In accordance with C&amp;MS 511, the Contractor will adjust the bearing seat elevations based on the actual project schedule. To accommodate this adjustment, Designers shall detail vertical reinforcement in the bearing seats with adjustable lap splices such that the minimum lap length coincides with D30. Do not include deflection due to the weight of FWS.
[702.6-2] DECK SLAB THICKNESS FOR CONCRETE QUANTITY: The estimated quantity of deck concrete is measured according to C&amp;MS 511. In addition to the design slab thickness, the quantity includes a variable haunch thickness that provides an allowance for: vertical grade adjustment, beam camber and additional sacrificial haunch thickness.
NOTE TO DESIGNER: Delete “vertical grade adjustment” from the above note when the project does not include such an adjustment.

Baseline aesthetic treatments for noise barriers include:
A.  Concrete wall panels with an Ashlar stone pattern form liner, or other approved formliner. Provide a surface treatment detail in the project plans. The Office of Environmental Services will approve formliners other than Ashlar stone pattern. Other wall panel materials (steel, fiberglass, etc.) will not require a form liner.
B.  Except when mounted on bridges and other structures, specify concrete posts.
C.  Provide a cap on noise barrier panels and posts to create a shadow line. Caps for posts should be of the same material as the posts and shall be integral with or mechanically fastened to the top of the post. Caps for panels shall be integral with the panel.
D.  General dimensions for the cap are: 1.  6-in high</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>4-in wider than the post and panel and centered so the cap horizontally extends 2-in beyond the panel or posts vertical surfaces. (Other options may be acceptable depending on limits of manufacturing process and final visual effect.)
E.  Baseline colors are beige, light gray, tan and plain uncoated concrete. The coating material used to produce the color is to be approved by the Office of Environmental Services. Determine the noise barrier color(s) in conjunction with the District Aesthetic Coordinator. The posts, caps and joints may have a color(s) different from the panels, but the color combination shall be visually appealing.
Color choices may also be limited due to noise panel material types. Agencies and/or designers specifying both color and wall panel material type should assure that the color is available.
Refer to ODOT’s Aesthetic Design Guidelines for requirements to specify Enhanced aesthetic treatments.
Clearly define the aesthetic requirements for each project in the noise barrier plan general notes.
The notes shall be detailed enough to assure detail finishes, form liners, caps, colors, coatings, application requirements, special design dimensions, etc. are not only adequately specified to assure the visual effect but

SECTION 900 – BRIDGE LOAD RATING
901 PURPOSE
The purpose of this Section is to provide consistency and uniformity in the procedures, guidelines and policies for determining safe live load carrying capacity or load rating of the highway bridges in the State of Ohio.
902 SCOPE
The guidelines, policies and recommendations provided in this Section are meant to assist bridge owners and bridge raters by establishing evaluation practices that meet the Ohio Revised Code (ORC), the National Bridge Inspection Standards, Specifications for National Bridge Inventory, ODOT Bridge Design Manual and American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials.
The intent of this Section is to establish standardized load rating procedures conforming to FHWA reporting requirements and posting bridges in the State of Ohio. The provisions of BDM Section 900 apply to ODOT bridges. All provisions of BDM Section 900 may also be applied to non-ODOT bridges at the discretion of the bridge owner.
903 APPLICABILITY
903.1 APPLICABILITY OF AASHTO DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS
<em>BDM Section 900 is consistent with the current AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications and Standard Specifications for Highway Bridges (14th Edition). Where this Section is silent, the current AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications or Standard Specifications for Highway Bridges shall govern for LRFR and LFR methods respectively.</em>
903.2 APPLICABILITY TO HIGHWAY BRIDGES
The provisions of this Section apply to all highway structures in Ohio that qualify as bridges in accordance with the definition for a bridge set herein. These provisions may be applied to smaller structures which do not qualify as bridges.
904 QUALITY MEASURES
To maintain the accuracy and consistency of load rating, bridge owners should implement appropriate quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) measures. Typical quality control procedures include the use of checklists to ensure uniformity and completeness, the review of reports and computations by a person other than originating individual and periodic field review of the inspection teams and their work.
Each load rating analysis shall be performed under the supervision of an Ohio registered professional engineer (i.e. the load rater) who will sign and stamp (seal) the final load rating report before submission to the bridge owner.

910.1 EXEMPT STRUCTURES THAT NEED A BR100
All structures exempt under this section, carrying highway traffic and maintained in the ODOT bridge inventory (have SFN/NBI Number) shall have a load rating summary form (BR100) filed based on the original design load of the structure and current field inspection. If the design load is unknown, the load rating summary form shall be filed based on rational evaluation.
When there are no signs of distress, structural damage or deterioration, load rating factors of 1.00 for inventory, 1.30 for operating and 1.500 for legal loads shall be used.
911 STRUCTURES UNDER 6.5-FT OR MORE FILL
Research conducted by the Ohio State University (sponsored by ODOT) has concluded that when a buried structure has 6.5-ft or more fill on the top, the live load effect on the structure due to vehicular traffic is negligible.
In case, a load rating analysis of the structure is not needed provided there are no other signs of distress, structural damage or deterioration, load rating factors of 1.00 for inventory, 1.30 for operating and 1.5 for legal loads and emergency vehicles shall be used.
912 WHICH PORTION OF BRIDGES SHALL BE LOAD RATED
Any structural member of a bridge that could carry vehicular traffic shall be load rated. Typically, the structural members of the bridge superstructure are load rated. Substructure elements, such as pier caps and columns, should be analyzed for their load carrying capacities in situations when they are either scoped to be analyzed or when the bridge owner or the rating engineer has reason to believe that the capacity of a substructure element may control the capacity of the bridge.

913 PROCEDURE FOR LOAD RATING
A.  New Bridges</li>
<li>Load rate new (proposed) bridges at the design stage per BDM Section 925. 2. The Project Manager shall forward the load rating report, bridge structure plans and data input files to the
OSE Bridge Rating Engineer for review. B. Existing Bridges</li>
<li>Perform a field inspection of the existing bridge according to the ODOT Manual of Bridge Inspection to determine its condition and the effectiveness of the various members for carrying load, if included in the scope. All information shown in the Bridge Inventory and the Inspection Reports shall also be carefully reviewed.</li>
<li>If a field inspection of the bridge is not a part of the Scope of Services, as a minimum, review the most current inspection report (and inspection notes, if available).</li>
<li>Perform the load rating per BDM Section 926.</li>
<li>Use the date of construction to determine the yield stresses for the construction materials in older bridges for which plan information is not available.</li>
<li>For a load rating being requested to the OSE, the District Bridge Engineer (DBE) shall make available to the OSE, Bridge Rating Engineer (BRE), a complete inspection report (including comments), bridge photographs, field measurements and a copy of the previous rating calculation sheets. BRE will review the submitted material, analyze the bridge, and return a copy of the final rating summary (BR100) to the DBE, along with any recommendations.</li>
<li>For load rating performed by the consultant and tasked by the District, the DBE, or Project Manager (PM) shall forward the load rating report, bridge structure plans, and data input files to the BRE for review. The BRE shall review the submittal and send the comments to the DBE/PM or the recommended BR100 to the DBE or PM.</li>
<li>For load rating performed by the consultant and tasked by the OSE, the consultant shall submit the load rating report, bridge structure plans, and data input files to the BRE for review. The BRE shall review the submittal and send the recommended BR100 to the DBE, after all comments are addressed.</li>
<li>Using pertinent current information and load rating analysis, the District Bridge Engineer/Bridge Owner shall determine and record the Inventory, Operating and Legal Load Ratings in AssetWise.</li>
<li>The District Bridge Engineer/Bridge Owner shall keep the final rating summary, rating calculations or computer output (if any) and the rating report along with any recommendations in the bridge file.
C. Influence Line Connected Rating Spreadsheets 1. If directed and included in the Scope of Services, prepare Microsoft Excel spreadsheets connected to
influence lines/surfaces to analyze a permit vehicle of up to 25 axles. 2. The Project Manager shall forward the load rating report, bridge structure plans, data input files and
spreadsheets to the BRE for review.
914 WHEN LOAD RATING SHALL BE REVISED
The load rating of a bridge should be revised when:
A1. The superstructure is replaced B1. The existing deck is replaced with a new deck
C1. The existing deck width has changed or there is an addition of new beam(s) or girder(s) in the cross-section D1. There is a change in the dead load on the superstructure, like addition or removal of wearing Surfaces, addition
or removal of sidewalks, parapets, railings, etc.
BDM Section 900 – Bridge Load Rating 2020 Edition – January 2025
9-18
E1. There is a physical change in the condition of a structural member of the bridge, which may change the capacity of the structural member.
F1. Rusting or damage to a slab, beam, girder, or other structural element has resulted in section loss and change in capacity.
G1. There is structural damage to steel, due to a hit by a vehicle or excessive deflection or elongation under temperature or highway loads.
H1. The bridge appraisal rating drops below 5 and every time it drops any step further below. I1. When exposed or broken prestressing strands are discovered. For each broken or exposed strand, consider the
adjacent strand(s) in the same row as ineffective.
J1. When a bridge is rated based on “Field evaluation and documented engineering judgement (code:0)” and the bridge appraisal rating drops a step.
The load rating of a bridge does not need to be revised when:
A2. The change in the thickness of external wearing surface is less than 1/2-in.
B2. The change in the dead load on a beam member is not more than 10-lbs/ft.
915 ANALYSIS OF BRIDGES WITH SIDEWALKS
Pedestrian loads on sidewalks are not typically considered in a load rating analysis of a highway bridge, regardless of if a sidewalk on the bridge is present or not. If a bridge owner has reasons to believe that the sidewalk loads shall be included in the load rating analysis of a bridge, a pedestrian load of 75-lbs/ft2 shall be applied to all sidewalks wider than 2-ft and considered simultaneously with the live load in the vehicle lane.
When pedestrian load is present, the pedestrian load effect multiplied with applicable load factor should be subtracted from the capacity of the member at the location being investigated when calculating the RF.
For bridges load rated according to the AASHTO Standard Specifications for Highway Bridges, AASHTO Table 3.22.1A applies. For bridges load rated according to the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications, refer to BDM Section 924.2.
Pedestrian loads shall not be considered when performing Special or Permit Load Analysis as per BDM Section 917.
BDM Section 900 – Bridge Load Rating 2020 Edition – January 2025
9-19
916 ANALYSIS FOR MULTILANE LOADING
A. Traffic lanes to be used for rating purposes shall be in accordance with AASHTO Specifications. B. For rating analysis of floor beams, trusses, non-redundant girders or other non-redundant main structural
members, position identical rating vehicles in one or more of the through traffic lanes on the bridge, spaced and shifted laterally on the deck within the traffic lanes to produce the maximum stress in the member under consideration.
C. Apply the multiple presence factors of AASHTO Standard Specification for Highway Bridges, Section 3.12 or AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specification, Section 3.6.1, accordingly.
D. If necessary, when combined with other unrestricted legal loads for rating purposes, the EVs need only to be considered in a single lane of one direction of a bridge. For rating analysis of transverse members, the EVs need only to be placed in one lane on the bridge, spaced and shifted laterally on the deck to produce maximum stress in the member under consideration. If there are more than one through traffic lanes on the bridge, use other unrestricted legal loads in other lanes.

919 BRIDGE POSTING FOR REDUCED LOAD LIMITS
919.1 BRIDGE POSTING POLICY
When the maximum load effects under Ohio law and AASHTO MBE exceed the load carrying capacity of a bridge, load posting must be considered following ODOT’s posting policy, to ensure the safety of the traveling public.  ODOT’s load posting policy is given below. It is applicable to all bridges carrying public highway traffic.</li>
<li>A bridge, not posted already, shall be posted for reduced commercial legal loads when the controlling rating factor of the legal loads (minimum of rating factors of all legal loads) is below the posting threshold of 1.08.</li>
<li>For bridges on the interstate system and all ODOT bridges not on interstate system, if a bridge is not posted for commercial legal loads, and the rating factor of any of the emergency vehicles (EV2 or EV3) is below 1.00, it will be posted for reduced loads of Emergency Vehicles only.</li>
<li>The posting load for any vehicle shall not be more than the legal gross vehicle weight (GVW). 4. The minimum load posting value is 3 tons. Bridges not capable of carrying a minimum gross legal weight of
3 tons shall be closed.
919.2 REFERENCE
Ohio Revised Code, Section 5591.42:
919.3 PROCEDURE FOR BRIDGE POSTING
The Procedure outlined in this section is to be followed for posting or rescinding warnings of bridge strength deficiencies on ODOT bridges. Owners of non-ODOT bridges may modify and adapt the guidelines given in this section to post or rescind warnings of bridge strength deficiencies on their bridges.
919.3.1 BRIDGE POSTING FOLLOWING LOAD RATING
A. A load rater performs the bridge load rating per the ODOT Bridge Design Manual (BDM). B. For an existing or in-service bridge, the bridge shall be load rated based on current dead loads and the last field
inspection report. The current operating status, inspection comments, photographs, and condition rating of structural elements shall be considered in the load rating.
C. Any structural deficiencies discovered during the most current field inspection, as recorded in the bridge field inspection report, shall be considered during the load rating process. The Control Authority Program Manager (CAPM) shall contact the load rater to request to reanalyze a bridge in service.
D. If load rating is performed by load testing, the test load configuration shall be noted.
E. The Load Rating Report shall be signed, sealed, and dated by an Ohio registered Professional Engineer. The load rating results shall be communicated to the CAPM who will enter/update the load rating results in the ODOT AssetWise.
F. If the load rating determines a need for the bridge posting, then the bridge will be analyzed by both LFR and LRFR methods. The method which produces generally higher rating factors shall be used to determine the need for bridge posting and posting loads. The BR100 shall be prepared based on the method selected.
G. Subsequent to load rating analysis, if it is determined that the bridge needs to be posted for reduced loads (i.e., below Ohio Legal Loads), the CAPM shall note in the AssetWise, “Bridge Posting Required.” The CAPM shall initiate the process to have the posting signs installed on the bridge no later than 30 days after a load rating determines a need for such posting (FHWA - October 1, 2019.)  The date of posting of sign shall be recorded in the AssetWise.
For ODOT bridges, the date on Director’s letter of posting will be used as the date of posting determination.   For Ohio Turnpike bridges, the date when the Chief Engineer approves the bridge posting will be used as the date
of posting determination.
BDM Section 900 – Bridge Load Rating 2020 Edition – January 2025

920 SOFTWARE TO BE USED FOR LOAD RATING OF ODOT BRIDGES
920.1 LIST OF ODOT PREFERRED LOAD RATING PROGRAMS
The bridge models developed during the load rating analyses are being used by ODOT Superload system to analyze and process hundreds of overload-permits every day. Superload system is configured to analyze bridges on a route in a fast and efficient batch process and minimize the permit analysis turnaround time. ODOT uses preferred programs to maintain and update the bridge models in the Superload system. ODOT has licenses of a few other load rating and analysis programs but not every analysis program is interfaced with the Superload system. The bridges which are not modeled using preferred programs require to be analyzed manually for permit loads, which substantially increases the process time.
A. AASHTOWare BrR: BrR is a load rating and analysis program developed and licensed by AASHTO. BrR can rate the bridges by LRFR and LFR methods. BrR can load rate a variety of bridge types including reinforced concrete box culverts and curved beam bridges. ODOT has a site license for BrR. Through a special pricing option, Counties, Cities and Consultants working on bridges in Ohio can obtain a stand-alone single user license of the BrR program from AASHTO. Please contact the ODOT Bridge Rating Engineer in the Central Office for a reference email.
B. AASHTOWare BrD: BrD is a bridge design check program developed and licensed by AASHTO. BrD can perform design check of a bridge by LRFR and LFR methods for compliance with current AASHTO Specifications. BrD program is fully compatible with BrR program, as data files created in BrD program can be used in BrR program to load rate a bridge. ODOT has a site license for BrD from AASHTO. Through a special pricing option, Counties, Cities and Consultants working on bridges in Ohio can obtain a stand-alone single user license of the BrD program from AASHTO. Please contact the ODOT Bridge Rating Engineer in the Central Office for a reference email.

924 LOAD RATING OF BRIDGES USING LRFR SPECIFICATIONS
924.1 APPLICABILITY OF AASHTO DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS
<em>This Section is consistent with the current AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications. Where this Section is silent, the current AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specification shall govern.</em>
924.2 GENERAL LOAD RATING EQUATION
The following general equation shall be used in determining the load rating of each component and connection subject to a single force effect (axial force, flexure, or shear) [MBE 6A.4.2]:
RF = C − (γDC)(DC) − (γDW)(DW) ± (γP)(P) − (γPL)(PL)
(γLL)(LL)(1 + IM 100⁄ )
For Strength Limit States:
C = ϕc ∙ ϕs ∙ ϕ ∙ Rn
Where the following lower limit shall apply:
ϕc · ϕs  ≥ 0.85
For Service Limit States:
C = fR
Where:
<em>C = Capacity DC = Dead load effect due to structural components and attachments</em>
<em>DW = Dead load effect due to wearing surface and utilities fR = Allowable stress specified in LRFD Code</em>
<em>IM = Dynamic load allowance expressed as percentage (%) LL = Live Load effect</em>
<em>P = Permanent loads other than dead loads, such earth pressure, shrinkage etc. PL = Pedestrian Load effect only to be applied when a sidewalk is present</em>
<em>RF = Rating Factor Rn = Nominal member resistance</em>
γDC = Load factor for DC load
γDW = Load factor for DW load
γp = Load factor for P load = 1.0
γLL = Evaluation live load factor
γPL = Load factor for PL load = 1.0
ϕc = Condition factor
ϕs = System factor
ϕ = LRFD Resistance factor
For Limit States and factors see BDM Section 924.3.

929 LOAD RATING OF BRIDGES WITH INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION
929.1 GENERAL
The purpose of this section is to specify ODOT policy on rating of bridges when complete bridge plans or sufficient information cannot be found in records or archives after all files and records are thoroughly searched.  Wherever possible, ODOT recommends modeling and load rate bridges using load rating programs preferred by ODOT. This ODOT policy is applicable to ODOT structures.  For non-ODOT bridges, this policy can be applied at the discretion of the bridge owner.
References shall be made to AASHTO Manual of Bridge Evaluation (MBE) Section 6.1.4, which addresses load rating of bridges with unknown structural components and National Cooperative Research Program (NCHRP) Synthesis 571, published in 2022, has stated common practices in the nation to load rate bridges and culverts with missing or incomplete as-built information.
The load rater will use one of the following methods or a combination of methods to load rate bridges without plans or with missing details.
When method A) or B) given in this policy is used to determine the load rating of a bridge, the rating information shall be coded as follows:
BDM Section 900 – Bridge Load Rating 2020 Edition – January 2025
9-44
NBI Coding:
NBI Items #63 and #65: Code “0”
NBI Item #64: Code operating rating in ton rounded down to nearest whole ton
NBI Item #66: Code inventory rating in ton rounded down to nearest whole ton
SNBI Coding:
Item B.LR.04: Code “EJ”
Item B.LR.05: Code inventory rating factor
Item B.LR.06: Code operating rating factor
Item B.LR.07: Code controlling legal load rating factor
929.2 METHOD A: LOAD RATING USING FIELD MEASUREMENTS AND HISTORICAL DATA (FH)
When bridge design plans or standard drawings used in design are not available or have missing information, determine if field measurements can be made to establish the overall dimensions of the bridge and the member cross-sections to create a bridge rating data model to analyze a bridge to calculate its load rating using one of the software programs preferred by ODOT.  Material properties can be assumed based on the historical data and ODOT specifications applicable at the time of the bridge construction (see Bridge Design Manual, BDM Section 926.2). General information about the material strengths based on the ranges of years of construction is provided in BDM Tables 926-1 through 926-3. Extra attention should be paid when the year of construction is close to the start or end of a range as materials during construction might have been substituted. It is recommended to use conservative values.
This method is recommended to be used for most common steel and timber bridges.
929.3 METHOD B: LOAD RATING BASED ON THE DESIGN LOAD AND RATIONAL EVALUATION (DLRE)
When method A) cannot be applied, the load rating of a bridge with insufficient information may be determined using the design load and current Bridge Appraisal Rating (BAR) provided the bridge is in service for some time. Prior to determining the final rating by this method, inspection and maintenance records including historical performance, deterioration, modification, and repair records etc. of the bridge shall be thoroughly reviewed to ensure that structural material, geometry and superimposed dead load have not changed, the appraisal ratings reflect current conditions, and no localized deterioration is present that controls the rating of the entire structure.
Initial rating is based on the assumptions that the bridge is in good condition, has known (or assumed) design loading which was in use when the bridge was built, and has the inventory rating (the capacity minus dead load effect) equivalent to its design loading demand. The operating rating is then calculated from the inventory rating (OR=1.67<em>IR).  The inventory rating factor is based on a HS20 truck assuming the design truck produces demand (moment and shear) in proportion to demand of a HS20 truck. The legal and EV rating factors are based on experience and rational evaluation.

929.4 METHOD C: LOAD RATING BASED ON THE FIELD TESTING (FT)
When it is not possible to perform load rating of a bridges due to insufficient plans, design information, or when the methods A) and B) do not yield results conforming to the observed performance, non-destructive load testing shall be performed to obtained desired load rating results.  MBE, Section 8.2 describes two types of tests for bridge evaluation: diagnostic tests and proof tests. Diagnostic tests are generally performed to validate analytical procedures. ODOT recommends use of static proof tests to establish the maximum safe load capacity of the bridge, where behavior of the bridge is within the linear-elastic range, following MBE, Section 8.8.3.
A load test is not recommended (MBE, Section 8.6) to be performed when:</li>
<li>The cost of testing reaches or exceeds the cost of bridge strengthening or bridge replacement.</li>
<li>Pretest evaluation shows the load test is unlikely to show the prospect of improvement in load carrying
capacity.</li>
<li>According to calculations, the bridge cannot sustain even the lowest level of load test.</li>
<li>There is a possibility of sudden failure (shear or fracture).</li>
<li>Load tests may be impractical because of access difficulties or site traffic conditions.

930 BRIDGE LOAD RATING QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE GUIDELINES
930.1 GENERAL
Code of Federal Regulations 23CFR650.313(p), Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the American Association of State Highway &amp; Transportation Officials (AASHTO) require using QC and QA processes to ensure and maintain high degree of accuracy and consistency in the load rating program and enhance safety. The FHWA and AASHTO recommendations were developed in response to the NTSB Recommendations No. 1 to AASHTO (H-08-20) and Recommendation No. 2 to FHWA (H-08-17).
BDM Section 900 – Bridge Load Rating 2020 Edition – January 2025
9-48
The objectives of the QC/QA guidelines are to produce ratings representative of the bridge, data files appropriately created free of errors and omissions, clearly define sources of information, and contain as complete information as possible for future maintenance of data files.  The information about the safe load carrying capacities of bridges obtained through the load ratings is used to determine the load posting needs of the bridges. Determination of safe load carrying capacity and load posting of a bridge are vital for the safety of the traveling public and ensuring the bridge will remain open and in service until it is strengthened, repaired, or replaced. Load rating and bridge posting information are also used in determining overall health of the system, &amp; maintenance needs, prioritizing repairs, rehabilitation and replacements, allocation of resources and forecasting future needs.
930.2 QUALITY CONTROL (QC) REVIEW PROCESS
To ensure and maintain a high quality of bridge load rating analyses, the QC reviewer shall conduct a review before submitting the final rating report to the owner.  The load rater must perform the load rating analyses, ensuring the assumptions, procedures, and data used are accurate and the most current deadload and inspection information are incorporated. A QC review is an internal process designed to verify the accuracy of data obtained from construction and repair and rehabilitation plans, field inspection reports, field measurements, as well as field and laboratory tests and other input parameters used in the analysis.  QC reviews are generally conducted by a QC reviewer, who is not the rater, assigned from within the same agency, or company, or entity, which is performing the load rating analysis. The names of the engineers performing the bridge rating and reviewing must be documented in the final rating report (BR100).
The reviewer shall follow the following steps when performing bridge load rating QC review:</li>
<li>The reviewer may use the same model that is created by the rater to check the analysis. In some instances, the reviewer may create his/her own independent model. If the same model that was generated by the rater is being used, the rater shall make a copy of the model and run it independently with the appropriate parameters to verify the load rating results obtained by the rater.</li>
<li>The reviewer shall use original construction plans and all rehabilitated/rebuilt plans (if applicable) and other available documents to verify the input parameters for the rating analysis.</li>
<li>The reviewer shall review the latest inspection report to see if there are any issues which may affect the rating analysis.</li>
<li>The reviewer shall independently verify the parameters which may affect the load rating to ensure accuracy, and compliance with the policies and procedures defined in the BDM.  The following list contains some of the parameters:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>thickness of the existing wearing surface/overlay on the structure - span length</li>
<li>girder spacing - ultimate strength of structural material, such as concrete, steel or wood</li>
<li>allowable tension or compression of the structural material (timber) - section properties of the structural elements, such as girders, slabs, etc.</li>
<li>quantity of mild steel used in the analysis. - number of pre-stressing strands used in the analysis.</li>
<li>strength and size (cross-sectional area) of the prestressing strands - location/placement of pre-stressing strands in the beam or girder</li>
<li>dead load and live load - proper application of composite and non-composite loads</li>
<li>legal vehicles and emergency vehicles used in analysis. - boundary condition, such as fix, pin, roller, and the values of the rotational springs, if used
BDM Section 900 – Bridge Load Rating 2020 Edition – January 2025
9-49</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The reviewer shall verify the assumptions and calculations (if used in rating) or perform independent calculations.</li>
<li>The reviewer, if necessary, may ask for clarification from the rater, request additional calculations, and if unsure
of any parameter/assumption, seek technical advice.</li>
<li>The reviewer shall verify the reasonableness of results. 930.3 FOLLOW-UP PROCEDURE FOR RESOLUTION
Any data issues identified during QC review, including errors, omissions, compatibility between items, changes, or any combination thereof, shall be resolved.  The data issues, errors, omissions, etc. shall be communicated to the rater by the reviewer and shall be corrected by the rater.  When an error in computer input, assumptions, or load calculations is found, consider what that error will do to the outcome. If the error has a negligible impact on the final rating, it may not be necessary to return the model back to the rater to revise and redo the rating.
When an error is found that will have significant impact on the remainder of the rating model and the results, return the rating model to the rater for correction prior to completing QC review. The rater may be required to resubmit the rating data files and reports after the resolutions of all review comments.  Significant impact is defined as when the error is leading to posting a bridge or a change of controlling legal rating factor of 5 percent or more.
The data issues of minor nature (which may not significantly affect the rating of the bridge) may be corrected by the rater or the reviewer after mutual consultation.
ODOT also performs courtesy reviews of the load rating data files of non-ODOT bridges designed, and rated through Local-let program for completeness, accuracy, compliance with scope, and reasonableness of results. The reviewer of the rating is responsible for the complete QC review.
930.4 ACCEPTANCE OF RATING DATA FILES
ODOT will only accept the rating data files which have been created according to BDM Section 900, following ODOT policies, and are free of errors. The ODOT engineer from the OSE accepting and saving the rating data files of bridges which are created in BrR program is responsible to ensure the data files run error-free by both LFR and LRFR methods unless an exception of a method of analysis is approved by the BRE.
930.5 RETENTION POLICY
All load rating reports, and the bridge posting/rescinding information shall be maintained in the bridge files during the service life of the bridge.  The most current rating values shall be coded in AssetWise.
930.6 QUALITY ASSURANCE (QA) PROCESS
To maintain high quality of load rating process and to ensure the QC procedures are being followed consistently, a QA review of the load ratings shall be performed by a qualified QA reviewer.  The QA process varies depending on the type of bridge, method of load rating used and who performed the load rating.
QA review of ODOT bridges occurs in the Load Rating Section of the Office of Structural Engineering. Local agencies shall designate qualified internal or external QA reviewers to perform such reviews.
The QA review may consist of two parts.
Part I – An office review of a representative sample of documents, data in AssetWise, and inspection reports for evaluation of the organization’s QC process, qualifications, resources, and documentation regarding the load rating for the bridges. Time required to post a bridge after determination of a bridge posting and evidence of presence of posting signs on bridges required to be posted shall also be reviewed.
Part II – If needed, review of a representative sample of the bridge files to ensure the bridge files are maintained correctly and current. This part is for county QA review.
BDM Section 900 – Bridge Load Rating 2020 Edition – January 2025
9-50
930.7 QA REVIEW FREQUENCY
The QA period for reviews of the load rating shall be one year (± 3 months from the previous QA review date).
930.8 QA REVIEW SAMPLING
The procedure, and sampling parameters for selecting bridges for independent review, shall be as follows:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>All bridges posted for reduced loads during the QA period. 2. Bridge rating files may be selected by searching for known or suspected inaccuracies.</li>
<li>10 percent of randomly selected load ratings (max = 40, min = 2) completed during the QA period.
930.9 RECOMMENDED FOLLOW-UP AND PROCEDURE FOR RESOLUTION
Results and recommendations based on the QA review are used to maintain the quality of the load rating program and make improvements where needed.  Following a QA review the comments and recommendations may be communicated through emails, phone calls or other means of communication. Online meetings may also be held if needed.  The resolution of the errors, omissions and/or comments shall be done in an expedited manner.
A. RATINGS PERFORMED IN-HOUSE BY ODOT  QA review findings and recommendations shall be communicated with the BRE, who will share them with the
Load Rating Group and QC reviewers.  The raters/reviewers may be required to fix errors, omissions, etc.
B. RATINGS PERFORMED BY CONSULTANTS FOR ODOT  QA review findings and recommendations shall be communicated to the Rater(s). The consultants in an active
contract with ODOT at the time of their review, may be asked to fix the errors and omissions in the bridge rating models and
C. RATINGS PERFORMED FOR LOCAL ENTITY  QA review findings and recommendations shall be communicated with the Program Managers. The Program
Managers/owners shall get the errors and omissions in the bridge rating models and reports fixed.

SECTION 1000 – ODOT SUPPLEMENT TO THE LRFD BRIDGE DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS
<em>This section of the Bridge Design Manual is the ODOT Supplement to the current edition of the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications. Designers shall use this section of the Bridge Design Manual as a complement to the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications. This section contains ODOT exceptions and commentary to various provisions as well as recommendations for optional provisions. Supplemented AASHTO articles are identified by the letter “S” preceding the article number (e.g. S1.3.3 DUCTILITY, SA13.4.1 DESIGN CASES, etc.). References to AASHTO articles are presented in italics (e.g. 1.3.3 DUCTILITY, A13.4.1 DESIGN CASES, etc.). References to ODOT Bridge Design Manual sections are always preceded with the initials BDM (e.g. BDM Section 305)</em>
1001 LRFD SECTION 1 - INTRODUCTION
1001.1 S1.3.3 DUCTILITY
For bridges and bridge components designed in accordance with the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications, apply a ductility load modifier (ηD) equal to 1.00 for all limit states.
1001.2 S1.3.4 REDUNDANCY
Non-redundant designs should be avoided.
The columns of single-column and two-column piers shall be considered non-redundant. The columns of cap-and-column piers with three or more columns shall be considered redundant. The stems of T-type piers with a stem height-to-width ratio of 3-to-1 or greater shall be considered non-redundant. Stems of wall-type and T-type piers, except as noted above, shall be considered redundant. NCHRP Report 458, Redundancy in Highway Bridge Substructures offers additional guidance for determining redundancy of other substructure types.
Refer to LRFD 10.5.5.2.3 for more information regarding redundancy of driven pile foundations.
Refer to LRFD 10.5.5.2.4 for more information regarding redundancy of drilled shaft foundations.
When determining redundancy in members, consideration shall only be given to the final design condition; temporary construction phases should be ignored.
The redundancy modifier shall be applied at the component level. For example, for a two-girder Type (a) or (k) superstructure, the 1.05 load modifier would apply only to the design of the girders. The redundancy modifier applied to the two-girder superstructure’s deck, cross-frames, expansion joints, bearings, substructure and foundation elements should be considered independently.
Designers are required to submit the Structure Type Study review submission and the Stage 2 review submission for bridge designs that include non-redundant or fracture critical elements to the Office of Structural Engineering.
1001.3 S1.3.5 OPERATIONAL IMPORTANCE
A bridge shall be considered a typical bridge with an operational importance load modifier (ηI) equal to 1.00 for all limit states except as noted below.
For bridges meeting one of the following criteria an operational importance load modifier (ηI) equal to 1.05 shall be applied at the strength limit states to all components except: railings; concrete slab-type superstructures; and concrete decks on beams and girders. An importance load modifier (ηI) equal to 1.00 shall be used for all other limit states.
A1. Design ADT of 60,000 or greater, or B1. Detour length of 50 miles or greater, or
C1. Any span length of 500-ft or greater.
BDM Section 1000 – ODOT Supplement to the LRFD Bridge Design Specifications 2020 Edition – January 2025
10-2
For bridges meeting both of the following criteria, an operational importance load modifier (ηI) equal to 0.95 may be applied at the strength limit states to all components except concrete decks on beams and railings. An importance load modifier (ηI) equal to 1.00 shall be used for all other limit states.
A2. Design ADT of 400 or less, and B2. Detour length of 10 miles or less.
The Detour length shall be shortest route available to emergency vehicles if the bridge is taken out of service.
1002 LRFD SECTION 2 – GENERAL DESIGN AND LOCATION FEATURES
1002.1 S2.3.2.2.2 PROTECTION OF USERS
For routes with design speeds in excess of 45 mph, pedestrian traffic and vehicular traffic shall be separated by a crash tested railing system. For routes with design speeds of 45 mph or lower, the Department requires a crash tested railing system to separate vehicle and pedestrian traffic when the pedestrian railing does not meet MASH or NCHRP 350 crash testing requirements. Refer to BDM Section 309.4 for more information.
1002.2 S2.3.3.2 HIGHWAY VERTICAL
The Department’s requirements for vertical clearance are provided in the L&amp;D, Vol. 1, Section 300. ODOT’s “Preferred” vertical clearances include 6.0-in for possible future overlays.
Apply the additional 1.0-ft of vertical clearance provided for sign supports and pedestrian overpasses to ODOT’s “Preferred” vertical clearance.
1002.3 S2.5.2.3 MAINTAINABILITY
<em>For structures with High Load Multi-rotational (HLMR) bearings, the plans shall show the location of permanent or temporary jacking points and provide jacking forces in accordance with LRFD 3.4.3.1. Both the superstructure and substructure shall be designed for the location and forces provided. Jacking points and forces are not required for other bearing types.</em>
1002.4 S2.5.2.4 RIDEABILITY
Where concrete decks without an initial overlay are used, the top 1.0-in of thickness shall be considered sacrificial to permit a maximum correction of the deck profile by grinding of 0.5-in and to compensate for a maximum thickness loss due to abrasion of 0.5-in. This top 1.0-in is commonly referred to as the monolithic wearing surface. Refer to BDM Section 309.1 for more information.
1002.5 S2.5.2.6.2 CRITERIA FOR DEFLECTION
Designers shall apply the deflection limits shown. Do not include the stiffness contribution of railings, sidewalks and concrete median bridge railings into the design of the composite section.
1002.6 S2.5.2.6.3 OPTIONAL CRITERIA FOR SPAN-TO-DEPTH RATIOS
Designers shall apply the minimum span-to-depth ratios shown in Article 2.5.2.6.3. See BDM Section 308.2.3.2 for span -too-depth ratios for adjacent box beam structures.
1002.7 S2.6.6.3 TYPE, SIZE AND NUMBER OF DRAINS
Refer to Section 1103 of the L&amp;D, Vol. 2 for ODOT’s design criteria for deck drainage.
1002.8 S2.6.6.4 DISCHARGE FROM DECK DRAINS
ODOT requires the minimum projection of scuppers below the lowest adjacent superstructure component to be 8.0-in. Refer to Standard Bridge Drawing GSD-1-19 for more information.

1003 LRFD SECTION 3 – LOADS AND LOAD FACTORS
1003.1 S3.4.1 LOAD FACTORS AND LOAD COMBINATIONS
The load combinations and load factors specified in Table 3.4.1-1 shall apply. If a bridge design warrants the use of a special design vehicle analysis, the Scope of Services will provide the necessary information. Otherwise, the Department does not require an analysis using a special design vehicle, and the Strength II limit state will not apply.
1003.2 S3.5.1 DEAD LOADS: DC, DW, AND EV
In lieu of more specific information, the assumed unit weight of normal weight reinforced concrete shall be 0.150-kcf.
Design all bridges for a future wearing surface of 60-psf applied to the clear roadway width between curbs and/or bridge railings. Refer to BDM Section 303 for more information.

For the duration of the impacting event, the vertical component of vehicle weight for the wheel closest to the point of impact is negligible. For Design Case 1 and 2, the load factor for vehicular live load (LL), including dynamic load allowance (IM), acting on the overhang shall be taken as 0.0 for the wheel load closest to the bridge railing and 1.0 for the wheel load furthest from the bridge railing. The position of the truck shall be in accordance with Article 3.6.1.3.1.</em>
1013.5 SA13.4.2 DECKS SUPPORTING CONCRETE PARAPET RAILINGS
For Design Case 1, the deck overhang shall be designed to resist a vehicular impact moment, MCT, and coincidental axial tension force, TCT, calculated as follows:
X2H2L RHM
C CT ++

RT C
CT ++ =
Where: R = Railing resistance to lateral impact force (kips)
H = Height of the railing (ft.) LC = Critical length of yield line failure pattern (ft.)
X = Lateral distance from toe of railing to deck design section (ft.) Unless otherwise specified, assume the railing resistance (R) to be the lesser of:
A. 1.33 times the transverse force (Ft) specified in Table A13.2-1, or
B. The calculated railing resistance specified in Article A13.3.1   The transverse force selected for design shall be that which corresponds to the bridge railing’s crash tested acceptance level (i.e. Test Level). The following table provides design overhang data for standard ODOT bridge railing types:

1013.6 S13.4.3.1 OVERHANG DESIGN
Refer to BDM Figure 309-3 and Figure 309-5 for the deck overhang reinforcement requirements for the TST-1-99 railing system. Alternative railing systems shall be considered for projects that do not meet the design assumptions for BDM Figure 309-3.
1014 LRFD SECTION 14 – JOINTS AND BEARINGS
1014.1 S14.4.1 GENERAL
Irreparable damage in accordance with BDM Section 303.1.4.1.c is permitted.
1014.2 S14.5.6 CONSIDERATIONS FOR SPECIFIC JOINT TYPES
Refer to BDM Section 309.6 for standard ODOT joint types and applications.
1014.3 S14.6 REQUIREMENTS FOR BEARINGS
Refer to BDM Section 306.4 for preferred ODOT bearing types and applications.
1014.4 S14.6.3.1 HORIZONTAL FORCE AND MOVEMENT
Bearings without directional seismic restraint are not required to accommodate seismic movements in the unrestrained direction. Irreparable damage due to seismic movement in accordance with BDM Section 303.1.4.1.c is permitted.
1014.5 S14.6.3.2 MOMENT
<em>For elastomeric bearings utilizing 4 anchor bolts connecting load plates to the bearing seat, Mu , shall be taken as specified by Eq. 14.6.3.2-3.</em>
For elastomeric bearings without anchor bolts and those with 2 anchor bolts centered at the centerline of bearing, no moment will be transferred from the superstructure to the substructure.
1014.6 S14.6.5.2 APPLICABILITY
A design strategy to reduce seismic design forces that permits the bearing to deform beyond its elastic limits during a seismic event without restraint is acceptable provided loss of span is prevented. As noted in BDM Section 303.1.4.1.b, Designers shall design the mechanisms for the Horizontal Connection Force that transfer horizontally applied superstructure loads to the substructure. These mechanisms are not required at every bearing location.
1014.7 S14.6.5.3 DESIGN CRITERIA
For bearings without directional seismic restraint, design for the horizontal connection force is not required.
Analysis of the load path for resistance to seismic design forces is not required.

1014.8 S14.7.5 STEEL-REINFORCED ELASTOMERIC BEARINGS – METHOD B
The preferred design of elastomeric bearings is Method A. Method B is recommended for use when specialized bearings are being considered. Since Method B designs have additional testing requirements versus Method A designs, these additional costs shall be factored into cost comparisons for Method A designs versus Method B designs versus specialized bearing designs.
The contract plans shall specify the method of bearing design. A sample plan note is provided in BDM Section 700.
1014.9 S14.7.5.3.2 COMPRESSIVE STRESS
The effect of impact shall be ignored.
1014.10 S14.7.5.3.4 SHEAR DEFORMATION
Designers shall assume the ambient temperature during setting is 60°F to calculate Δo.
1014.11 S14.7.5.3.7 SEISMIC AND OTHER EXTREME EVENT PROVISIONS
Anchor bolts for restrained elastomeric bearings shall be designed for the horizontal connection forces in the restrained directions in accordance with BDM Section 303.1.4.1.b. Elastomeric bearings, not otherwise requiring anchor bolts, do not require seismic anchoring and irreparable damage is permitted under BDM Section 303.1.4.1.cFigure 309-3.
